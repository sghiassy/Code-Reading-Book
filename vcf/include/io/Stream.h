*Stream interface defines a core set of funcationality for streams 
*in the Visual Component Framework derived Streams should support "stream chaining", 
*the ability of the stream constructor to support an incoming stream from 
*someother stream object. For example:
*	<p><pre>
*		MyStream s = new MyStream( new MemStream( new GZIPStream( SomeBigDataObject ) ) );
*	</pre></p>
*	assuming SomeBigDataObject supports Persistable, then the object is read into the
*	GZIPStream and compressed, the compressed bytes are sent to the Memory stream, and
*	then this is sent to MyStream.
*
*Streams are meant as alternative to the C++ streams, though in some 
*cases they may extend the standard C++ stream library.
