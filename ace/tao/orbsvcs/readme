  TAO's CORBA Object Services Directory Hierarchy
  
   The file and directory organization for TAO services can be confusing
   at first glance (and even on subsequent ones to be honest), so we felt
   like some rationale and explanation of the directory hierarchy was
   needed.
   
   For general sanity all TAO services files are located under
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs.
   
   It is expected that clients use more than one service at the same time
   (in fact some of the services already do, for instance the Event
   Service uses the Naming Service and the Scheduling Service). For this
   reason all the services stubs are grouped in one library. This library
   is located in $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs. Usually the include path is
   only $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs, so files are included like this:
   
   #include "orbsvcs/CosNamingC.h"
   
   To simplify the IDL generation the skeletons are also on the library,
   this is not a problem for client programs and most services need to
   link the library anyway (since they use other services.) Further, the
   current support for collocation requires that clients link the
   skeleton files anyway.
   
   In the future we intend to use ACE Service Configurator to give the
   users control over collocation of the services implementation. As a
   first cut all the service implementations are included in the orbsvcs
   library $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs. Since there are serveral services
   and each one is implemented using several files we have given a
   different directory to each service. This structure could also
   simplify a future split into several libraries (if it proves
   necessary).
   
   The complete list of directories is:
   
   Service Implementation Sub-directory
   A/V Streams Service orbsvcs/AV
   Concurrency Service orbsvcs/Concurrency
   Event Service orbsvcs/CosEvent
   Real-time Event Service orbsvcs/Event
   LifeCycle Service orbsvcs/LifeCycle
   Load Balancing Service orbsvcs/LoadBalancing
   Logging Service orbsvcs/Log
   Naming Service orbsvcs/Naming
   Property Service orbsvcs/Property
   Scheduling Service orbsvcs/Sched
   Security Service orbsvcs/Security
   SSLIOP Pluggable Protocol orbsvcs/SSLIOP
   Trading Service orbsvcs/Trader
   Time Service orbsvcs/Time
   Notification Service orbsvcs/Notify
   
   Note that in the current version of TAO we still have standalone
   binaries for some of the services. However, some applications may want
   to control what process implements a particular service. Therefore, it
   has proved useful for debugging purposes to keep the most used
   services separated. The binaries in question are located in
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs, and the list includes:
   
     * Concurrenty_Service
     * Dump_Schedule
     * LifeCycle_Service
     * LoadBalancer
     * CosEvent_Service
     * Event_Service
     * Naming_Service
     * Scheduling_Service
     * Trading_Service
     * Time_Service
     * ImplRepo_Service *(see below)*
     * Notify_Service
       
   In the future we plan to use a single binary and ACE Service
   Configurator and keep a single binary.
   
   The Implementation Repository is a unique service in that it starts
   server executables, and it doesn't make sense to collocate it in
   another server. Because of this, only the IDL files are located in
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs. The other files are all located in
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/ImplRepo_Service.
   
   Finally the tests and example programs are located in
   $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/tests; once more each may involve more than a single
   binary, so each one is kept in its own directory; the following list
   describes the contents of each one:
   
   Test directory Purpose
   AVStreams A complete A/V server and client.
   Concurrency Test the Concurrency Service.
   CosEC_Basic Test the basic functionality of the standard Event
   Service.
   CosEC_Multiple Simple example that connects multiple consumers and/or
   suppliers to the standard event service. It can be used to show how
   composing a standard event-service and the real-time event service
   provides filtering capabilities.
   EC_Basic Test the basic functionality of the real-time Event Service.
   EC_Custom_Marshal Show how the Real-time event service can send user
   defined data using custom marshaling.
   EC_Mcast Multiple real-time event channels can communicate using
   multicast, this example shows how to do it.
   EC_Multiple Connect two Real-time Event Channels using the EC_Gateway,
   measure latency, utilization and minimum spacing.
   EC_Throughput Measure throughput and latency for collocated and remote
   real-time event services.
   Event_Latency Test the Real-time Event Service and measure end-to-end
   latency, it also uses the Scheduling and Naming services.
   ImplRepo Tests used to test the functionality of the Implementation
   Repository Service.
   LoadBalancing Test that exercises the Load Balancing service.
   Logger An example logging service using the Naming Service to locate a
   factory.
   Naming This is an obsolete directory.
   Property Testing for the Property Service.
   Sched A test of the Scheduling Service.
   Security Tests that verify that the Security Service is functioning
   properly. Tests for auxiliary Security Service components such as the
   SSLIOP pluggable protocol also exist in this directory.
   Simple_Naming A number of Naming Service tests: from very simple to
   more fancy.
   Simulator Prototype implementation of DOVE (DOVE Agent, DOVE Browser,
   DOVE MIB, DOVE Application). The DOVE Agent consists of the Event
   Channel, which is then connected to a DOVE Browser implemented in
   Java.
   Trading Tests for the Trading Service.
   Time A test for the Time Service.
   Notify Consists of basic tests foe the Notification Service - Simple
   event transfer, client Connect-Disconnect to event channel, creating
   and destroying channel/admin objects,test for Admin properties, test
   to check offer/subscription changes. The directory also has
   performance tests for throughput.
