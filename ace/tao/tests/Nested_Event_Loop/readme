Description:

This is a test of invoking nested event loop calls from user code,
i.e., a call to perform_work() or run() from the implementation of the
servant.

Expected output:

The client and server should be able to make steady progress, i.e.,
should not deadlock.

How to run:

You can use the run_test.pl script to run it or:

$ server
$ client
