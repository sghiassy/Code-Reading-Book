  Building and Installing ACE and Its Network Services
  
    Synopsis
    
   The file explains how to build and install ACE and its Network
   Services on the various OS platforms and compilers that it has been
   ported to. Please consult the [1]ChangeLog file to see whether any
   recent changes to the release will affect your code. You also might
   want to read the ACE [2]FAQ before building and installing ACE. In
   addition, you might want to check out our [3]development process, as
   well. And as you start working with ACE, you might want to consult the
   [4]ACE Frequently Made Mistakes page. If you encounter any problems or
   would like to request an enhancement, then use our [5]bug tracking
   system to submit a report.

  Platforms, C++ Compilers, and Support
  
   ACE has been ported to a large number of [15]platforms, using many
   different compilers over the years. The [16]DOC group, [17]Riverace,
   [18]OCI, and members of the ACE user community have all contributed
   ports to make ACE the successful and far-reaching toolkit it is today.
   Any UNIX/POSIX/Win32 variation is a potential target platform for ACE.
   If you have [19]porting questions or have a problem compiling the ACE
   source distribution, please contact one of the commercial support
   companies, or send a copy of the PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM to either the
   [20]ACE Newsgroup or the [21]ACE mailing list and someone will try to
   help you fix the problems.
   
   The responsibility for maintaining ACE across this wide range of
   platforms is divided among a few different groups: the DOC group,
   Riverace, OCI, and the ACE user community itself. The table below
   summarizes each group's role and where you can get more detailed
   information. For information on TAO's platform coverage and support,
   please also see [22]TAO's install document.
   
   CAPTION: Groups Involved in ACE Development and Support
   
   Group Platforms For more information
   DOC Group [23]Tested and used daily by the DOC group: Solaris 2.5,
   2.6, 7 and 8 (many compilers excluding SunC++ 4.x)
   Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 (MSVC++ 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x, and Borland
   C++ Builder 5.0)
   Linux/Intel (many compilers), Linux/IA64 (GCC). DOC sites at [24]UCI
   and [25]Washington University
   Riverace Offers support services for many platforms including those
   above, HP-UX, and AIX. Riverace's [26]web site
   OCI Maintains ACE on certain platforms required for their TAO software
   and service offerings. OCI's [27]web site and the TAO [28]install
   document
   ACE user community Responsible for continued maintenance and testing
   of platforms to which ACE has been ported, but aren't supported by the
   above groups. These include Windows 95/98/CE using Borland C++ Builder
   4.0 and later, IBM VisualAge C++, and GNU g++ on MinGW; Digital UNIX
   (Compaq Tru64) 4.0 and 5.0; IRIX 6.x; UnixWare 7.1.0; SunOS 4.x and
   Solaris with SunC++ 4.x; Linux on Alpha and PPC; OpenMVS; Tandem; SCO;
   FreeBSD; NetBSD Chorus, OS/9, PharLap TNT Embedded ToolSuite 9.1, QNX
   RTP and Neutrino 2.0; VxWorks; LynxOS; RTEMS
   
   Although the DOC group has provided outstanding, world-class support
   for ACE over the years, ACE's success has greatly increased the amount
   of effort required to keep up with its maintenance, answer users'
   questions, and give design guidance. Riverace offers world-class
   commercial services to support ACE users and OCI offers similar
   services for TAO, allowing the DOC group's primary focus to shift back
   to their main goal: research. The DOC group is fundamentally focused
   on (and [29]funded by) advanced R&D projects. The group continues to
   be intimately involved in ACE+TAO development and maintenance, but
   with revised priorities for maintenance. The [30]bug fixing policies
   followed by the DOC group are designed to strike a balance between
   their many [31]research projects and their commitment to the ACE+TAO
   [32]user community. Naturally, we will be happy to accept well-tested
   patches from the ACE+TAO user community for any platforms that aren't
   supported by the DOC group, Riverace, or OCI.

  Installation Notes
  
     * Win32 (Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows '9x/ME) 
       All of ACE has been ported to the Win32 API (which includes
       Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows '95/98/ME). The entire
       release now compiles using the Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0, and 6.0
       compilers. ACE can be built as both a static (LIB) and dynamic
       (DLL) library, using the Win32 installation process described
       below.
       Please see the [33]Non-static ACE_Object_Manager discussion below.
       We've also added some support for [34]GNU g++ with Mingw, Borland
       C++ Builder 4.0/5.0 and IBM's VisualAge C++ compiler. Since we
       don't have these compilers we rely on the ACE+TAO users community
       to maintain these ports. Therefore, please send email to the ACE
       mailing list if you run into problems.
     * Windows CE
       Take a look at ([35]CE-status.txt) for up-to-date information
       about ACE on CE.
     * SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x, 7 and 8 using Sun Sun C++ 4.2 and 5.x,
       Forte 6, Centerline C++ 2.x, GNU gcc 2.7.x and later (except
       2.8.x), and KAI C++ 3.3/3.4.
       All the source code and tests should build and run without any
       problems on Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, and 8 platforms using the Sun
       C++ compilers. For Sun C++ 4.2, we recomend using this patch
       version at a minimum:

      CC: WorkShop Compilers 4.2 21 Apr 1997 C++ 4.2 patch 104631-02

       There are likely to be build problems with older versions or
       different patchlevels of Sun C++.
       Thanks to Susan Liebeskind <shl@janis.gtri.gatech.edu> for
       providing the following useful information:
       The home page for Sun technical patches is
       [36]http://access1.sun.com. Searching for 104631 will bring you to
       a page allowing you to access the latest version of the C++ 4.2
       patches.
       By default, ACE uses both the Solaris and POSIX thread interface.
       To disable use of the Solaris thread interface, add
       -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS to the CFLAGS in your
       ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU. See the
       Solaris Intro (3) man page for more information.
       To disable ACE thread support completely, build with the threads=0
       make flag. See the [37]Makefile Flags section below for more
       information on make flags.
       If you use g++ or egcs on Solaris 7, you might need to rebuild it
       on a SunOS 5.7 (Solaris 7) host. Some versions of g++ and egcs
       provide replacements for system header files. The replacements on
       older SunOS systems are not compatible with the SunOS 5.7 system
       headers. See [38]David Levine's Hints page for instructions on how
       to build egcs on a SunOS 5.7 host, using a g++ or egcs that was
       built on an older SunOS host.
       The Sun/C++ 5.0 compilers has several problems with templates, we
       have worked around most of them but this is not a compiler that we
       test very often. Hopefully as new patches for the compiler show up
       we will be able to make that our compiler of choice on Solaris.
     * Sun OS 4.1.x using Centerline C++ 2.x, Sun CC 3.x, and Lucid
       Energize 3.2.
       Note that shared libraries do not interact very well with
       Centerline C++ or Sun C++ on SunOS 4.1.x. This is due to odd
       behavior of the SunOS 4.1.x linker, which (1) does not properly
       call constructors of global objects within shared libraries and
       (2) does not call the init() and fini() functions in shared
       libraries, even though the manual claims that these functions are
       called! In particular, this means that the tests in the directory
       $ACE_ROOT/tests/Service_Configurator/IPC-tests/server/ will not
       work for statically linked services.
       Some versions of SunOS 4.1.x do not contain the /usr/lib/libnsl.a
       library. This library seems to be optional since System V
       Transport Layer Interface (TLI) support is optional on SunOS 4.1.x
       (in contrast, it's the "preferred" transport interface on
       Solaris).
       The best work-around for now is probably to either add a dummy
       libnsl.a in /lib (which may not be feasible) or simply comment out
       the line:
       LIBS += -lnsl
       in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/wrapper_macros.GNU file.
       Naturally, any programs, e.g., the TLI_SAP tests, that use the TLI
       wrappers aren't going to work!
       Note that on SunOS 4.x you may get warnings from the linker that
       "archive has no table of contents; add one using ranlib(1)" for
       certain libraries, e.g., libASX.a, libThreads.a, and libSPIPE.a.
       This occurs since SunOS 4.x does not support these features.
     * AIX
       The ACE port to AIX assumes that the user has installed the AIX
       patch containing the dl*() APIs. To use these APIs, IBM has
       created a separate product (free to AIX licensees) called shared
       library hookable symbols (or slhs/6000). If you don't have this
       patch, the sv* commands for compiling and linking will not be
       present on the system.
       If you are using AIX 4.2.1 or later, this patch isn't needed; the
       dynamic library APIs are included in the base operating system.
       However, another patch may be needed. Thanks to Susan Liebeskind
       <shl@janis.gtri.gatech.edu> for submitting the following useful
       information:
       When building on AIX 4.2.1, using the xlC V3.1 compilers, you may
       get the following error when building the ACE shared library.

makeC++SharedLib_r -p 0 -o libACE.so  -bI:/lib/pse.exp  -L/usr/local/src/ACE_wr
a
ppers/ace -L./ -ltli_r -ldl libACE.a
ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: .__CurrentException
ld: 0711-345 Use the -bloadmap or -bnoquiet option to obtain more information.
make: *** [libACE.so] Error 8

   To fix this error, you need a patch to the supporting xlC related
       libraries. To obtain this patch, go to the [39]IBM public patch
       website, and retrieve the patch PTF U453697, or its successor, for
       xlC.
       You may wish to retrieve this patch with the fixdist tool, also
       available at the website. Installation of this patch will install
       patched versions of the C++ libraries, which correctly define this
       symbol.
       To build ACE on AIX with Visual Age C++ 5 in incremental mode
       (i.e. with the IDE), use the $ACE_ROOT/ace/ace.icc configuration
       along with the appropriate version-specific config file (e.g.
       config-aix-4.3.x.h). All of the version-specific config files set
       the version number macros and include the general config-aix-4.x.h
       file which has support for all of the OS versions and compilers
       supported on AIX. Using the general config file is the recommended
       practice for egcs, C Set++, IBM C/C++, and Visual Age C++ 5 batch
       mode compilers.
       Visual Age C++ 4 has also been supported on ACE 5.1, but is no
       longer supported. If you are still using this compiler, please use
       the $ACE_ROOT/ace/ace-dll.icc configuration file, along with the
       config-aix-4.3.x.h ACE config file. Beware, however, that it
       hasn't been tested. BTW, here's a technique from Rob Jordan
       <[40]jordan@hursley.ibm.com> that can reduce the size of the ACE
       libraries by about one third, and can also be applied to
       applications. It works by optimising the sharing of template
       functions, which are created in an "unusual" way under AIX. It
       also speeds up compilation.
       Here's how to optimise the ACE library generation:
       Look at the [41]Makefile in $ACE_ROOT/ace. Create a file called
       ACE_All_Src.cpp, and add a line to #include each of the source
       files listed under FILES= in the Makefile. Create a file called
       ACE_All_Tmp.h and add a line to #include each of the .h files
       listed under TEMPLATE_FILES= in the Makefile. Now update the
       Makefile so that FILES=ACE_All_Src and TEMPLATE_FILES=ACE_All_Tmp.
     * Linux
       ACE has been ported to [42]Linux on Intel, Alpha, and PowerPC
       platforms. If you use a RedHat 5.x distribution, it's best to use
       RedHat 5.1 or later. ACE works without any modifications on RedHat
       5.1 and later, and on Debian 2.1 on both Intel and Alpha. Make
       [43]symbolic links to the include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU
       and ace/config-linux.h as your platform_macros.GNU and config.h
       files, respectively. The same files can be used on PowerPC, with
       LinuxPPC 1999 (R5), with glibc 2.1.1.
       If you run out of memory, it's easy to add virtual memory on
       Linux. Please see the mkswap man page. You'll need around 256 to
       300 Mb of virtual memory (RAM + swap) to compile all of ACE+TAO.
       The [44]System Resource Requirements section has some suggestions
       on how to reduce the memory requirement.
       The glibc 2.0 dynamic loader isn't thread safe. If you want to use
       the Invocation API you'll have to set LD_BIND_NOW=true. If you
       want to use dlopen, you should use RTLD_NOW. The dynamic loader in
       glibc 2.1 is thread safe.
       The ACE Tokens_Test hangs with egcs 1.1b on Linux. It runs
       properly when built with egcs 1.0.2 and later. All other ACE tests
       run properly with these egcs 1.0.2 and later.
       NOTE: The TAO NameService uses IP multicasting by default, though
       it is not required. IP multicast on Linux requires the following:
          + Enable IP multicast in the Linux kernel. It is enabled in the
            default RedHat 5.1 kernel. In older distributions, you can
            enable it by rebuilding your kernel with CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
            enabled.
          + Enable IP multicast in ACE. It is enabled by default in
            ace/config-linux-common.h. If you don't use IP multicast, add
            #define ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST 0 to your ace/config.h before
            building ACE.
          + There must be a network interface that is up and supports
            multicast. If you have linuxconf, it's easiest to use that to
            add a network route for multicast (224.0.0.0) on one of your
            network interfaces, such as eth0. If you don't have or use
            linuxconf, try adding a multicast routing table entry using
            something like this:

             # route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0

       With RedHat 5.0, you'll need some [45]updates and possibly some
       patches to get ACE working with LinuxThreads. Some of the patches
       are necessary with Alpha CPUs and with some older kernels. egcs
       1.0.1 can also be used, but it may need patches, described there,
       as well.
       NOTE: Be careful when installing egcs on RedHat systems. If you
       don't remove your old gcc and libg++ RPMs, it's best to install
       egcs in a different directory than /usr, such as /usr/local, and
       set your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly.
       Some of the ACE tests fail on older, pre-glibc2 Linux platforms,
       such as RedHat 4.2. The problems are with threads and
       thread-specific storage.
     * SCO UNIX
       ACE has been ported to SCO UNIX using the GNU g++ 2.7.2 compiler.
       Arturo Montes <[46]mitosys@colomsat.net.co> maintains this code.
       In addition, he also maintains a version of [47]FSU pthreads.
     * SGI IRIX 5.x and 6.x
       ACE used to build fine using the SGI C++ and GNU GCC compilers for
       IRIX 5.x. It has been ported to IRIX 6.x using the SGI MipsPro 7.1
       C++ compiler; be aware that in IRIX 6.2 there is a number of
       patches that have to be installed and exceptions appear to fail
       with the O32 ABI. Please check the config files for the details.
     * HP-UX 9.x, 10.x, and 11.00 
       HP sells 2 C++ compilers for HP-UX 10.x and 11.00. If you are
       using 9.x, there's only the first one.
          + HP C++ - this is CC, HP's cfront-based compiler. As of ACE
            4.4, it can be used, but some people have problems with
            templates. Caveat emptor. It's been said that you should run
            version 10.24, if not later.
          + HP aC++ - this is aCC, HP's new, ANSI compiler. It handles
            ACE very well. You should use version A.01.27 (or higher) on
            HP-UX 10.x and version A.03.27 (or higher) on HP-UX 11.00.
       On HP-UX 10.20, a patch is required to compile ACE. The exact
       patch number depends on the platform - check with HP's patch
       database to locate the exact patch or its successor. For 9000 700
       series machines it is PHKL_8693 (s700 10.20 sys/time.h fix for
       select(2)/C++ defects).
       Also see further notes on this platform at Riverace's
       [48]Frequently Asked Questions page.
     * OSF/1 3.2 and 4.0 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX 4.0)
       The Digital UNIX C++ 5.4 through 5.7 compilers have problems with
       ACE's templates. They compile the lib and most of the test
       programs, although they warn about template usage. Most tests run,
       some dump core. If you use a 5.x version of cxx, be sure to set
       the CXX_VER variable to CXX_5, either on your make command line or
       in an environment variable. The ACE Makefiles assume by default
       that the cxx version is 6.x or later.
       CXX 6.0 and 6.1 are much improved over 5.x: V6.0-020, V6.1-025,
       and later build all of ACE cleanly. All of the tests in
       ACE_wrappers/tests run successfully with CXX 6.0 and CXX 6.1.
       Please note that problems have been reported with some versions of
       CXX 6.1, notably versions -021 and earlier. It's best to use
       V6.1-022 or later.
       NOTE: if you use Digital UNIX 4.0f or later, you must use
       ace/config-tru64.h instead of ace/config-osf1-4.0.h.
       ace/config-tru64.h can be used for all supported compilers on any
       version of Digital UNIX after and include 4.0. And, with 4.0f and
       later when using Digital CXX, you must use
       include/makeinclude/platform_tru64_cxx.GNU instead of
       include/makeinclude/platform_osf1_4.0.GNU. GNU gcc 2.7.2.1
       compiles without problems. All tests run (besides minor problems).
       Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <[49]kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
       and David Trumble <[50]trumble@cvg.enet.dec.com> for help with
       this port.
     * FreeBSD 
       FreeBSD is a fast evolving platform. However, it has the advantage
       of having standard releases. At this moment, ACE is only
       perodically tested against -stable (3.1R) and we rely a lot on
       FreeBSD users' feedbacks.
       Notice that on older FreeBSD, ld.so only looks for so libraries
       with version number appended. ACE makefiles create symlinks for
       most shared libraries if versioned_so is defined to 1 in
       $ACE_ROOT/ace with appropriate ACE version. However, this does not
       work for libACE.so itself so you have to create it manually (If
       you figure out how to do this, please let us know) like this:
       ln -sf $ACE_ROOT/ace/libACE.so $ACE_ROOT/ace/libACE.so.4.5
       On newer FreeBSD (3.0 or later,) this is no longer necessary.
     * NetBSD
       Like older FreeBSD, NetBSD's ld.so also requires versioned .so
       files.
     * UnixWare 
       Steve Huston <[51]shuston@riverace.com> has ported ACE to work
       with UnixWare 2.01 and g++.
       Ganesh Pai <[52]gpai@voicetek.com> subsequently did the port for
       version 2.1.2, also with g++.
       Phil Mesnier <[53] mesnier_p@ociweb.com> updated the port to
       support UnixWare 7.1.0, with help from Michael Meissnitzer <[54]
       michael.meissnitzer@siemens.at>, Christian Klepp <
       [55]christian.klepp@siemens.at > and Engelbert Staller <[56]
       engelbert.staller@siemens.at> Building ACE (and TAO) on Unixware
       7.1.0 requires a very specific g++ build environment. In
       particular, you must build and install g++ 2.95.2, along with
       binutils 2.9.1. The order (and the declaration of configuration)
       is extremely important. Using the gcc compiler provided on the
       Skunkware CD on a pentium system, here is the recipe I used to
       build a working environment (as root):

  mkdir /usr/local/newgnu
< ftp and untar binutils-2.9.1 >
< ftp and untar gcc-2.95.2 >
  mkdir -p build/binutils build/gcc
  cd build/binutils

     * Chorus
       Wei Chiang <[57]chiang@tele.nokia.fi> has ported ACE to Chorus 3.1
       using GNU g++ 2.7.2.
     * LynxOS
       ACE builds and runs properly on LynxOS 3.0.0 for Intel and PowerPC
       targets. ACE's Naming_Test fails; it is disabled in
       [58]ACE_wrappers/tests/run_tests.sh.
       If you run out of memory on LynxOS, these might help:
          + Increase the limits in /etc/starttab, then logout and login
            again. We use these limits:

# Data, stack, and core file limits (in Kbytes)
240000
80000
102400
          + Enable or expand virtual memory, with something like:

# mkcontig /swap 320
# prio 17 vmstart /swap
        See the mkcontig and vmstart man pages, and /bin/rc.
       Please see the comments in the [59]ACE platform_lynxos.GNU file
       for information on, and an example of, tailoring for your
       particular platform.
       We actively maintain ACE on LynxOS 3.0.0. It should build and run
       on LynxOS 2.5, but we no longer test on that OS version.
       NOTE: if you want to use IP multicast on LynxOS, be sure to add
       this line to your /net/rc.network, and reboot:

        /bin/route add "224.0.0.0" "$my_name"

   Dave Mayerhoefer <[60]davem@lynx.com> has ported ACE to LynxOS 2.5
       using GNU g++ 2.7.2. However, you may need to apply some
       [61]patches to LynxOS to get ACE working.
     * VxWorks
       [62]David Levine <[63]levine@cs.wustl.edu> has ported ACE to
       VxWorks 5.2/5.3/5.3.1/5.4 with the GreenHills 1.8.8/1.8.9 and g++
       compilers that are distributed with VxWorks/Tornado. An anonymous
       contributor has also provided [64]notes for using ACE with VxWorks
       5.1.
       Tornado II/VxWorks 5.4 support IP multicast. That is not enabled
       by default in ACE for VxWorks, because it probably depends on
       kernel configuration. To enable it, add #define
       ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST to your ace/config.h.
       In addition to all of the other benefits of ACE, it helps work
       around some deficiencies with VxWorks 5.3/5.3.1. Some of these
       apply only with g++, at least thru version 2.7.2. That is the
       version that is shipped with Tornado 1.0.1/ VxWorks 5.3.1. The
       problems are:
         1. The program entry point cannot be called "main" with g++. ACE
            renames it to "ace_main" (configurable via ACE_MAIN) on
            VxWorks. While this may seem trivial, it is important with
            legacy code. ACE itself ran into this problem.
         2. argc/argv isn't used with VxWorks entry points. ACE provides
            a wrapper function that transparently converts shell command
            line arguments to argc/argv form. See [65]below for details.
         3. Unsigned long long support is not available with the g++ that
            is distributed with Tornado 1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1, or with
            GreenHills 1.8.8. The documentation says that it is supported
            by g++, but try using it :-) Wind River technical support
            verified that it doesn't work. ACE provides its own 64-bit
            unsigned integer type, ACE_hrtime_t, so you don't even have
            to worry about this problem if you use it.
         4. There a gory problem with munch that is severely aggravated
            by the presence of a static in the Wind River/g++ iostream.h.
            ACE hides this and provides an easy-to-use workaround in the
            very unlikely situation where it becomes a problem. Please
            see ace/config-vxworks5.2-g++.h for more information.
       In addition, as noted [66]below following the discussion of the
       g++ -fno-implicit-templates option, -fno-implicit-templates is
       broken for x86 targets. And, -O2 is not supported on some targets.
       Please note that ACE uses one of the spare fields in the Wind
       River task control block, spare4, for thread- specific storage.
       This field is specified in only one place, in ace/OS.i, so it can
       easily be changed to one of the other spare fields, if necessary.
       Versions of ACE from 4.3.3 and beyond destroy dynamically
       allocated singletons in the ACE library. But, they may not
       properly destroy some static objects. If you have trouble running
       a program multiple times, it may be necessary to unload the
       module, using unld, and reload it between runs. Alternatively, you
       could try calling cplusDtors and then cplusCtors between runs.
     * MVS OpenEdition
       All of ACE has been ported to OpenEdition by Chuck Gehr
       <[67]gehr@sweng.stortek.com>. The ACE library, all the tests and
       most of the examples and apps build clean. There are still some
       problems that need to be ironed out:
       MVS does not support the dynamic linking dl...() calls that the
       Service Configurator uses to dynamically link services at run
       time. As a result, all the examples and apps that use a svc.conf
       file (for dynamically configuring service objects) do not work,
       however, most of these apps can be built/run statically. Also, the
       Svc_Conf_l.cpp and Svc_Conf_y.cpp files are generated using flex
       and yacc on a ascii (not ebcdic) machine and as a result they
       don't work very well with ebcdic svc.conf files. We should be able
       to regenerate these files on MVS but MVS doesn't have flex. This
       is something that needs to be done.
       Some of the tests do not execute properly. This is a minority and
       over time the goal is to get to 100%.
       The make scheme for some of the apps still doesn't work perfectly
       on MVS. This is mainly due to the way shared libraries are handled
       on MVS. See [68]additional build tips for MVS for more on this.
     * QNX Neutrino
       ACE has been ported to [69]QNX Neutrino 2.0. We cross-compile for
       Neutrino on a QNX4 host using g++ 2.8.1, using the
       [70]ace/config-qnx-neutrino.h and
       [71]include/makeinclude/platform_qnx_neutrino.GNU configuration
       files. Many of the ACE tests succeed, though some fail. As the
       porting effort progresses, we hope to eliminate these failures. If
       you know of fixes, please send them to us.
     * QNX RTP
       ACE has been ported to [72]QNX RTP . We compile for QNX RTP using
       the GCC compiler shipped with the distribution, using the
       [73]ace/config-qnx-neutrino.h and
       [74]include/makeinclude/platform_qnx_neutrino.GNU configuration
       files. Many of the ACE tests succeed, though some fail. As the
       porting effort progresses, we hope to eliminate these failures. If
       you know of fixes, please send them to us.
       WARNING: Under the current version of QNX RTP ACE fails if
       compiled with debug=1 (i.e. "-g" option in GCC).
     * PharLap TNT Embedded ToolSuite (ETS)
       ACE has been ported to [75]PharLap's TNT Embedded ToolSuite (ETS)
       version 9.1. The port is being tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.
       To build for PharLap, use the ace/config-pharlap.h configuration
       file, and the instructions for building on Win32. Building the ACE
       library is the same as for regular Win32 platforms, except you
       choose one of the PharLap ETS configurations to build within
       Visual C++. Only static library configurations are available for
       PharLap at this time. For an example of how to build binaries, see
       the tests directory. The tests_pharlap_msvc.lnk file is a LinkLoc
       commands file that the ACE tests are built with. It is likely that
       local sites may need to adjust this file for their target
       environment.
       If you have any fixes or suggestions for improving this port,
       please contact [76]Steve Huston.
     * Mac OS X (10.0.x, not public beta)
       The Mac OS X port of ACE is very much a work in progress. Some of
       the examples build and run, some of them don't yet. Reactors seem
       to work, while Proactors don't (Mac OS X doesn't use aio_* calls
       for async i/o, it uses the OS X Event Queue instead, and the ACE
       port doesn't take this into account yet). Also, on OS X, you must
       set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to $ACE_ROOT/ace
       i.e. setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace, or else none of the
       examples will be able to find libACE.dylib. John Zorko
       <[77]j.zorko@att.net> began this port for a work project, and
       basically only ported enough of ACE to be able to do what we
       needed to with it on Mac OS X. If you would like to continue the
       port, please contact John since he as interested in seeing ACE
       run, lean, mean and fully supported, on Mac OS X.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    Compiling ACE with GNU g++
    
   If you use the GNU GCC g++ compiler please note the following:
     * If you have problems building shared libraries with egcs 1.1 or
       1.1.1 on SunOS 2.5 or 2.5.1 that look like this:

        /usr/ccs/lib/libgen.a(reg_compile.o): In function `_get_vars_storage':
        reg_compile.o(.text+0x30): relocation truncated to fit: R_SPARC_GOT13 f
ree

   the suggested workaround is to comment out the ACE_HAS_REGEX #define
       in ace/config-sunos5.5.h. Or better, create an ace/config.h that
       looks like:

      #ifndef ACE_CONFIG_H
      // ACE_CONFIG_H is defined by the following #included header.

      #include "ace/config-sunos5.5.h"

      #undef ACE_HAS_REGEX

      #endif /* ACE_CONFIG_H */

   We don't know what causes the link problem, though the workaround
       solves it.
     * With g++ 2.8.0, an internal compiler error is raised when trying
       to compile ACE_Map_Manager instantiations. One workaround is to
       disable optimization. The easiest way to do that is:
% make optimize=0
   Or, you can edit your include/makeinclude/platform_sunos5_g++.GNU, and
       comment out the OCFLAGS line.
     * ACE/TAO don't seem to build well with g++ 2.8.1. We routinely use
       egcs 1.1.1 (on Solaris) and 1.1.2, and recommend those versions.
     * Earlier (prior to 2.7.2) versions of g++ may not compile certain
       parts of ACE correctly due to compiler bugs. Please upgrade to g++
       2.7.2 or greater.
     * Make sure to update your gcc config.status file. This file is
       produced when installing gcc; it specifies where to install the
       binary files that gcc uses. For example, it specifies whether to
       use Solaris's /usr/ccs/bin binary utils or GNU binary utils. The
       config.status file is an output of the gcc configure script; it is
       preferable to use the --prefix option to configure instead of
       hacking its output.
     * If you are getting weird link errors when building libACE on
       Solaris you are probably using the GNU linker. Try using the Sun
       linker (/usr/ccs/bin/ld) instead. Note that gcc first looks for
       the GNU linker if it is installed along with gcc. The only way to
       not use the GNU linker is to delete it from the installation or to
       build your own compiler with no linker. Be aware that you still
       need the libraries and includes of gcc.
       NOTE: if you do use the GNU linker, you might need to change the
       -G flag to -shared in the SOFLAGS definition in your
       include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU.
     * Don't get too confused about contradictory statements in the gcc
       documentation. It was written by different people...
     * Make sure that the linker invoked by gcc produces code that
       initializes static objects. Please see gcc's documentation for
       using collect2.
     * By default, gcc (thru version 2.7.2, at least) uses implicit
       template instantiation. Besides wasting space, this breaks the use
       of ACE_Singleton: instead of one singleton instance, there could
       be one instance per object (.o) file that "sees" the template.
       Therefore, we have overridden this default in ACE by enabling the
       -fno-implicit-templates option to CCFLAGS in all
       include/makeinclude/platform_*.GNU files that set CXX to g++.
     * The disadvantage of this approach is that you must add template
       specializations for all templates that your application uses to
       your own code. (The ACE libraries are self-contained: you don't
       need to add the templates that they use internally.) Examples of
       template specializations occur in quite a few ACE .cpp files; see
       the end of [78]apps/Gateway/Gateway/Connection_Handler.cpp for one
       example. An easy way to figure out what template instantiations
       are need is to try to build your executable and pipe the output
       through c++filt. The linker will report the missing instantiations
       as undefined symbols. Iteration may be necessary, if the template
       instantiations themselves reference other templates.
     * Alternatively, you could use the -frepo option available with
       recent egcs versions (2.90 and later, I think) instead of
       -fno-implicit-templates. (Patches for earlier g++ versions might
       be available from [79]Cygnus.) ACE readily supports this option
       for application code: to enable it just add repo=1 to your make
       invocation, or to your include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU.
       The size of the ACE library is typically reduced by about 25
       percent with repo=1, compared to the default with
       -fno-implicit-templates. This savings results from not
       instantiating unused classes, and from not instantiating unused
       member functions of those template classes which are instantiated.
       However, repo=1 requires care if your application creates
       libraries, in order to avoid multiple instantiations. We avoid the
       problem in ACE (and TAO) by including all of the ACE object files
       into other ACE (and TAO) libraries. Please see the g++ FAQ and gcc
       manual for more information on the -frepo option.
       Furthermore, it appears that g++ may have problems instantiating
       all templates properly with -frepo. We have worked around these
       problems (by using explicit instantiations even with
       ACE_HAS_GNU_REPO) with egcs 1.1.2. A quick try with g++ 2.95
       showed more problems, so we don't support repo=1 with that g++
       version, yet.
     * The implementation of templates for g++ version 2.8 eliminates the
       restriction against static data members in template classes.
     * A final alternative is to remove the -fno-implicit-templates
       option from the CCFLAGS macro in your
       include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU, and thereby use the
       default g++ implicit template instantiation.
     * Thanks to Thilo Kielmann <[80]kielmann@informatik.uni-siegen.de>
       for reporting the problem with ACE_Singleton on g++, and for
       helping to find and implement these solutions.
     * On VxWorks only, g++ (thru version 2.7.2, distributed with Tornado
       1.0.1/VxWorks 5.3.1), for x86 targets, -fno-implicit-templates is
       broken. In addition, -O2 is not supported on some targets.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
    Compiling ACE with egcs
    
     * ACE transparently supports egcs, for the most part. Please see
       [81]Compiling ACE with g++ in this document. And, please use the
       appropriate g++ config and platform files for the OS on which you
       will use egcs.
     * WARNING: The default behavior of the ACE Makefiles is to add
       -fno-exceptions to egcs (and g++ starting with version 2.8.0)
       invocations. This disables exception handling support. On
       Solaris/sparc and Linux/alpha, it results in a 25 percent
       reduction in the size of libACE.so. To enable exception handling,
       add exceptions=1 to your make command line invocation, or to your
       $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU.
     * egcs may have trouble linking some executables, such as the ACE
       IOStream_Test, if its static libraries are used. Though [82]Tim
       Rose reports that egcs 1.1.1 static libraries work just fine on
       Solaris 2.6 with patches: 105181-12, 105568-13, 105210-19,
       105591-05, 105395-04, and 105490-07.
       If you need or want to use egcs' shared libraries, build it with
       the --enable-shared egcs config option. The --enable-shared option
       is not an egcs run-time option. Build egcs in a way similar to the
       following example:

         $ ./configure --enable-shared
         $ make bootstrap

   Be sure to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, if
       necessary, to pick up those shared libraries.
     * On DEC Alpha, egcs through version 1.03a, at least, may fail to
       build ACE if debugging (-g) is enabled. The fix is to edit the
       egcs gcc/mips-file.c file, at line 976, and change PAGE_SIZE to
       8192. Then rebuild ACE. Thanks to [83]Ganesh Pai for this
       information.
     * Sun OS 5.6 using egcs1.1.2/egcs 2.95 with ld:Software Generation
       Utilities - Solaris/ELF (3.0) as: WorkShop Compilers 4.X dev 18
       Sep 1996
       You could come across weird external symbol linker errors.
       Example:

   external symbolic relocation against non-allocatable section .stab;

       Solution:
       Install the "binutils" package from GNU (www.gnu.org);
       specifically, "as" and "ld".
       Conclusion:
       Perfect build stats:
       OS: Kernel version: SunOS 5.6 Generic 105181-03 December 1999.
       compiler: gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
       loader: GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1) Supported
       emulations: elf32_sparc
       assembler: GNU assembler version 2.9.1 (sparc-sun-solaris2.6),
       using BFD version 2.9.1
       Thanks to [84]John Gathright for providing this information.
     * Compiling using the -fsquangle option helps to shorten long symbol
       names and is a boon to linkers and assemblers which cant grok long
       names. Thanks to [85]Skye Sweeney for trying it out and [86]Ossama
       Othman for discovering the option with egcs.
       Heres a note on how to go about this (contributed by Skye
       Sweeney):
       1) -fsquangle the name is a combination of squash and mangle!
       2) -fsquangle compresses the mangled names.
       3) All libraries must be compiles with the option. You cannot
       simply compile modules that have large names with it. This
       includes system libraries and vendor libraries like RogueWave.
       4) The "simple" solution is not to add the option to each
       makefile, but rather recompile the compiler to have the option on
       by default. This is done by editing the file `gcc/cp/decl2.c',
       setting `flag_do_squangling = 1', then rebuilding the compiler and
       libraries.
       5) After many false starts and linking snafus, I can recompile my
       ACE/TAO/RogueWave/Lex/Yacc 100 Meg application.

  Building and Installing ACE
  
   The following explains how to build ACE on [87]UNIX and [88]Win32.
   
    General Rules
    
     * Many features in ACE can be modified by defining some macros in
       $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h. These macros should always appear before
       including your platform specific config file.
     * However, if you want to undefine/redefine macros defined in the
       platform specific config file, these #undef should come after the
       config file.
     * If you're planning to build ACE on multiple platforms, you may
       want to consider [89]cloning the source tree before you start.
   ___________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on UNIX
    
   Building and installing ACE on UNIX is relatively simple (the
   [90]process for Win32 is different). Here's what you need to do:
   
    1. Install [91]GNU make 3.7 or greater on your system (available via
       anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu/make/
       directory). You must use GNU make or ACE won't compile.
    2. Add an environment variable called ACE_ROOT that contains the name
       of the root of the directory where you keep the ACE wrapper source
       tree. The ACE recursive Makefile scheme needs this information.
       There are several ways to set the ACE_ROOT variable. For instance,
       in my .login file I have the following entry:

      % setenv ACE_ROOT /home/cs/faculty/schmidt/ACE_wrappers

       However, if you're building a number of versions of ACE, e.g., for
       different OS platforms or for different releases of ACE, you might
       use the following approach:

      % setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd

    3. Edit the $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file to update things like default
       hostname and port numbers you'd like the programs in the
       $ACE_ROOT/{apps,tests} directories to use by default. Note,
       however that you can normally skip this step because the defaults
       are typically fine for most systems.
    4. Create (via ln -s or cp) a $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h file that
       contains the appropriate platform/compiler-specific header
       configurations, e.g.,

% ln -s config-sunos5-sunc++-4.x.h config.h
   This file contains the #defines that are used throughout ACE to
       indicate which features your system supports (see the
       $ACE_ROOT/ace/OS.h file for many examples of how the ACE build
       configuration is affected by these macro settings). Make sure you
       settings are placed before the inclusion of the platform-specific
       header file.
       There are config files for most versions of UNIX. If there isn't a
       version of this file that matches your platform/compiler, you'll
       need to make one. Please send me email if you get it working so I
       can add it to the master ACE release.
    5. Create (via ln -s or cp) a
       $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file that
       contains the appropriate platform/compiler-specific Makefile
       configurations, e.g.,

% ln -s platform_sunos5_sunc++.GNU platform_macros.GNU
   This file contains the compiler and Makefile directives that are
       platform/compiler-specific
    6. Note that because ACE builds shared libraries, you'll need to set
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH to whereever you put the binary version of the ACE
       library. For example, you probably want to do something like the
       following

      % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    7. When all this is done, hopefully all you'll need to do is type:

      % make

       at the root of the ACE source tree. This will build the ACE
       library, tests, the examples, and the sample applications.
       Building the entire ACE release can take a long time and consume
       lots of disk space, however. Therefore, you might consider cd'ing
       into the [92]$ACE_ROOT/ace/ directory and running make there to
       build just the ACE library. As a sanity check, you might also want
       to build and run the automated [93]"one-button" tests in
       [94]$ACE_ROOT/tests/. Finally, if you're also planning on building
       [95]TAO, you should build the [96]gperf perfect hash function
       generator application in [97]$ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf/.
    8. If you need to regenerate the Svc_Conf_y.cpp file, you'll need to
       get [98]Berkeley YACC. However, you should rarely, if ever, need
       to do this.
   ___________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on Win32
    
   Below are instructions for building ACE with [99]Borland C++Builder,
   [100]Microsoft Visual C++ and [101]Mingw.
   
   First, if you are upgrading from an older release, clean up everything
   and rebuild from scratch to ensure that everything is rebuilt
   correctly. You might have to manually go through the ACE directories
   and delete all *.obj, *.dll, *.lib, *.ilk, *.pdb, *.idb, *.ncb, *.opt,
   and *.exp files in order to start over from scratch (the Clean command
   in MSVC may not do this).
   
   ACE contains project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 or later
   (*.dsw) and IBM's VisualAge C++ compiler (*.icc). There are also
   Makefile.bor files to compile ACE, the ACE one-button tests, and TAO
   with Borland C++ Builder.
   ___________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on Win32 with Borland C++Builder
    
   If you are building for a machine without a network card, you may want
   to check [102]here first.
   
    1. Uncompress the ACE distribution into a directory, where it will
       create an ACE_wrappers directory containing the source. The
       ACE_wrappers directory will be referred to as ACE_ROOT in the
       following steps -- so ACE_ROOT\ace would be C:\ACE_wrappers\ace if
       you uncompressed into the root directory.
    2. Create a file called config.h in the ACE_ROOT\ace directory that
       contains:
       #include "ace/config-win32.h"
       If you are building for Windows NT or Windows 2K then you can
       start without any more changes. If you are building on Windows
       9x/Me, then you should add the line
       #define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h and it will
       turn off some WinNT/Win2K-specific code in ACE.
    3. Open a Command Prompt (DOS Box).
    4. Set the ACE_ROOT environment variable to point to the ACE_wrappers
       directory. For example:
       set ACE_ROOT=C:\ACE_wrappers
    5. Change to the ACE_ROOT\ace directory.
    6. Build release DLLs for ACE by going:
       make -f Makefile.bor
    7. You can build debug DLLs for ACE by setting the DEBUG environment
       variable before you run make:
       set DEBUG=1
       make -f Makefile.bor
    8. Optionally install the ACE header files, libraries and executables
       for use in your applications. Here we are installing them into
       C:\ACETAO:
       make -f Makefile.bor -DINSTALL_DIR=C:\ACETAO install
       
   These instructions do not cover all possible build configurations.
   Please see [103]http://www.tenermerx.com/tao_bcb/index.html for more
   detailed information on building and using ACE+TAO with Borland C++
   Builder.
   
   If you are using C++Builder 4, then the libraries built using the
   above instructions are intended for use with generic console or
   windows applications and they link against the corresponding C++
   runtime library. VCL applications created using BCB4's RAD environment
   must link against the VCL-compatible (ie pascal-compatible) runtime
   library. To tell the difference between these libraries the
   VCL-compatible ones have a 'p' in the suffix (i.e., 'p' for pascal).
   To build VCL compatible libraries try
   
set PASCAL=1
make -f Makefile.bor

   The Borland C++ Builder 4.0/5.0 port has been done by [104]Jody Hagins
   and [105]Christopher Kohlhoff.
   
   ACE TESTS
   
   The tests are located in ACE_ROOT\tests. You build the tests using the
   Makefile.bor file, that is:
   
     make -f Makefile.bor
     
   Once you build all the tests, you can run a perl script:
   
     run_test.pl -ExeSubDir Dynamic\Release
     
   or the the batch file:
   
     run_tests.bat bor
     
   in the tests directory to try all the tests. You need to make sure the
   ACE bin directory (in this case ACE_ROOT\bin\Dynamic\Release) is on
   the path before you try to run the tests.
   ___________________________________
   
    Building and Installing ACE on Win32 with Microsoft Visual C++
    
   Note concerning MSVC 5.0 and Service Pack 3: There has been confusion
   regarding MSVC 5 and its Service Pack 3. Some ACE users have, in the
   past, had problems with SP3 that were not present in SP2. Thanks to
   the diligent efforts of [106]Bill Fulton, the mystery appears to be
   solved. The key? (Oh, this is a good one...) It would appear that
   there are actually multiple versions of SP3 in existence. The earlier
   ones have the bug, while later ones have it fixed. The service pack
   downloadable from Microsoft's web site as of June 16, 1998 works fine.
   The CD containing SP3, if it has part number X03-50158 on the disc
   (the part number on the jacket is probably different), also works
   fine. Note, however, that regardless of the version of SP3, there are
   some STL bugs in SP3 which you should get corrected. Please see
   [107]http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html for details. Thank you to
   [108]Ben Eng for the pointer to the STL fixes.
   
   Right now there is a SP4 (and hopefully only one of them) which fixes
   a deadlock problem in the STL.
   
   We no longer actively support MSVC 4.x or earlier. ACE might work with
   these compilers but probably not without a bit of effort.
   
    1. Uncompress the ACE distribution into a directory, where it will
       create a ACE_wrappers directory containing the distribution. The
       ACE_wrappers directory will be referred to as ACE_ROOT in the
       following steps -- so ACE_ROOT\ace would be C:\ACE_wrappers\ace if
       you uncompressed into the root directory.
    2. Create a file called config.h in the ACE_ROOT\ace directory that
       contains:
       #include "ace/config-win32.h"
    3. Now load up the project file for ACE (ACE_ROOT\ace\ace.dsw).
    4. Each project will contain several different configurations. These
       are a mixture of Debug/Release, MFC/Non-MFC, and Static/Dynamic
       library versions. Make sure you are building the one you'll use
       (for example, the debug tests need the debug version of ACE, and
       so on). All these different configurations are provided for your
       convenience. You can either adopt the scheme to build your
       applications with different configurations, or use ace/config.h to
       tweak with the default settings on NT.
       Note: If you use the dynamic libraries, make sure you include
       ACE_ROOT\bin in your PATH whenever you run programs that uses ACE.
       Otherwise you may experience problems finding ace.dll or aced.dll.
    5. If you are building for Windows NT or Windows 2K then you can
       start building without anymore changes. If you are building on
       Windows 9x/Me, then you should add the line
       #define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h and it will
       turn off some WinNT/Win2K-specific code in ACE.
    6. If you want to use the standard C++ headers (iostream, cstdio, ...
       as defined by the C++ Standard Draft 2) that comes with MSVC, then
       add the line:
       #define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h.
    7. To use ACE with MFC libraries, also add the following to your
       config.h file. Notice that if you want to spawn a new thread with
       CWinThread, make sure you spawn the thread with THR_USE_AFX flag
       set.
       #define ACE_HAS_MFC 1
       By default, all of the ACE projects use the DLL versions of the
       MSVC run-time libraries. You can still choose use the static (LIB)
       versions of ACE libraries regardless of run-time libraries. The
       reason we chose to link only the dynamic run-time library is that
       almost every NT box has these library installed and to save disk
       space. If you prefer to link MFC as a static library into ACE, you
       can do this by defining ACE_USES_STATIC_MFC in your config.h file.
       However, if you would like to link everything (including the MSVC
       run-time libraries) statically, you'll need to modify the project
       files in ACE yourself.
    8. Static version of ACE libraries are build with ACE_AS_STATIC_LIBS
       defined. This macro should also be used in application projects
       that link to static ACE libraries
       Optionally you can also add the line
       #define ACE_NO_INLINE
       before the #include statement in ACE_ROOT\ace\config.h to disable
       inline function and reduce the size of static libraries (and your
       executables.)
    9. ACE DLL and LIB naming scheme:
       We use the following rules to name the DLL and LIB files in ACE
       when using MSVC.
       "Library/DLL name" + (Is static library ? "s" : "") + (Is
       Debugging enable ? "d" : "") + {".dll"|".lib"}
       
   More information for ACE/TAO on MSVC can be found [109]here. The
   doxygen version of this document is available under Related Topics in
   the ACE Library.
   
   ACE TESTS
   
   The tests are located in ACE_ROOT\tests. There is also a workspace in
   that directory to build all the tests (tests.dsw)
   
   Once you build all the tests (Batch Build works well for this), you
   can run perl script run_test.pl or the the batch file
   [110]run_tests.bat in the tests directory to try all the tests.
   
   BUILDING ACE ON A WIN32 MACHINE THAT LACKS A NETWORK CARD
   
   You may want to run ACE on a non-networked machine. To do so, you must
   install TCP/IP and configure it to ignore the absence of a network
   card. This is one method:
   
    1. Run Control Panel
    2. Choose Network from Control Panel
    3. Add Adapter: MS Loopback Adapter
    4. Configure MS Loopback Adapter with 802.3 (default)
    5. Add Protocol: TCP/IP Protocol
    6. Configure TCP/IP Protocol with a valid IP address and subnet mask.
       Leave everything else at the default settings.
    7. Add Service: Workstation
    8. Exit and Restart System
    9. Run Control Panel again
   10. Choose Services from Control Panel
   11. The following services are not necessary and may be set to
       Disabled Startup:
       Alerter
       Computer Browser
       Net logon
       Messanger
   12. Choose Network from Control Panel
   13. Confirm the following setup. This is all you need to run ACE:
       Installed Software:
       Computer Browser
       MS Loopback Adapter Driver
       TCP/IP Protocol
       Workstation
       Installed Adapter Cards:
       MS Loopback Adapter
       
   WIN32 ALPHA CONFIGURATIONS
   
   The project files for Visual C++ no longer contain any configurations
   targetted to Windows NT on the DEC Alpha. Below are the steps needed
   to recreate the Alpha configurations:
   
    1. Load the project on the Alpha machine.
    2. Go to the Build menu and then select Configurations.
    3. Select the project that you want to convert.
    4. Click on Add.
    5. Select the x86 configuration to "Copy settings from" (either Debug
       or Release versions).
    6. Prepend "Alpha " to the beginning of the name under
       "Configuration".
    7. Click OK.
    8. Close the "Configurations" window.
    9. Now go to the Project settings.
   10. For the General Settings, change the output directories to
       standard ACE output directories. Intermediate Directories are
       "Debug" and "Release" in most cases. The Output Directories are
       blank, except for Release versions of executables, in which it is
       also "Release".
   11. For the C/C++ Settings, make sure that the Code Generation's
       runtime library is set to "Multithreaded DLL" or "Debug
       Multithreaded DLL".
       
   Note: MSVC 6 has a bug where if a .dsp is converted from version 5 to
   6 on x86, the Alpha configuration can get corrupted. This seems to
   happen when additional include or library directories are specified
   using backslashes instead of forward slashes. If this occurs, the
   easiest way to fix it is to recreate it.

    Building and Installing ACE on Win32 with Mingw
    
   If you are building for a machine without a network card, you may want
   to check [111]here first.
   
   Building and installing ACE on [112]Mingw uses a mix of a [113]UNIX
   building process and [114]Win32 configuration files. Also, as Mingw
   uses GNU g++, you may want to take a look at the [115]Compiling ACE
   with GNU g++ section.
   
   You will need the Mingw build tools and libraries, downloable from
   [116]http://www.mingw.org. For our build we required the following
   packages: 
   
     gcc, binutils, ld, libbfd, mingw-runtime, w32api.
     
   You will also need GNU make for Win32 and the set of UNIX tools that
   the ACE UNIX build system uses (this include but is not limited to sh,
   rm, cp). For this purpose you can grab the [117]cygwin distribution
   from [118]http://cygwin.com.
   
   Be careful, because cygwin includes it's own version of the compiler
   and build tools, you will need to have the Mingw build tools before
   the cygwin set on you PATH environment variable (more on this later).
   The steps we followed in the build are:
    1. Install cygwin (this can be easy downloading and running
       [119]setup.exe from the cygwin site).
    2. Install the Mingw tools. Download all the needed packages (see
       [120]above) and unpack them on the same base directory, say
       c:/mingw32. If some of the packages are distributed on .tar.gz
       format, you may need to use the cygwin version of the tar utility.
    3. Open a cygwin shell. Set your PATH environment variable so your
       Mingw's bin directory is first:
       
       % export PATH=//c/mingw32/bin:$PATH

       Note cygwin uses ``/'' as directory separator, and ``//X'' as a
       notation for Win32 drive X. Note also that you can't use
       ``c:/mingw32/bin'' because, for cygwin, ``:'' is path separator
       character, as in UNIX.
    4. Add an ACE_ROOT environment variable pointing to the root of your
       ACE wrappers source tree:
       
       % export ACE_ROOT=c:/work/mingw/ACE_wrappers

       Note here you can't use the ``//X'' cygwin notation as this is
       seen by Mingw's compiler and it doesn't support that (it does
       support ``/'' as directory separator however).
       From now on, we will refer to the root directory of the ACE source
       tree as $ACE_ROOT.
    5. Add a MINGW_BASE environment variable pointing to the root of your
       Mingw instalation. Following the above example, set:
       
       % export MINGW_BASE=c:/mingw32

       Again, use Mingw syntax and not cygwin syntax for the directory
       specification.
    6. Create a file called config.h in the $ACE_ROOT/ace directory that
       contains:
       
       #include "ace/config-win32.h"

       If you are building for Windows 9X/Me (ie, not WinNT or Win2K),
       you will need to add:
       
       #define ACE_HAS_WINNT4 0

       before the #include line. Also, if you don't have Winsock 2 (check
       the SYSTEM and/or SYSTEM32 subdirectories of the windows
       instalation directory for ws2_32.dll), you will need
       
       #define ACE_HAS_WINSOCK2 0

       before the #include line. On NT 4, Windows 98 and later versions,
       you surely have Winsock 2. In Windows 95, including OSR2, you may
       don't have it if it wasn't specially installed. You may download
       it from the [121]microsoft site. This is recommended as much ACE
       functionality depends on Winsock 2, and ACE without Winsock 2
       support is tested very infrequently.
    7. Create a file called platform_macros.GNU in the
       $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude directory containing:
       
       include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_mingw32.GNU

       In the above text, don't replace $(ACE_ROOT) with the actual
       directory, GNU make will take the value from the environment
       variable you defined previously. If you lack Winsock 2, add the
       line
       
       winsock2 = 0

       before the previous one.
    8. On the cygwin shell, change to the $ACE_ROOT/ace directory and run
       make:
       
       % cd $ACE_ROOT/ace
       % make

       This should create libACE.dll (the Win32 shared library) and
       libACE.dll.a (the Win32 import library for the DLL). Note the name
       for the ACE DLL on Mingw follows the Mingw convention, that
       resembles UNIX.
       If you want static libs also, you may run:
       
       % make static_libs=1

    9. The same rules for Win32 search of DLLs apply for Mingw. If you
       want to run some ACE programs from the cygwin shell, you may need
       to add the directory for libACE.dll to your PATH:
       
       # export PATH=//c/work/mingw/ACE_wrappers/ace:$PATH

       ACE TESTS
       The tests are located in $ACE_ROOT/tests. After building the
       library, you can change to that directory and run make:
       
       % cd $ACE_ROOT/tests
       % make

       Once you build all the tests, you can run run_tests.sh in the
       tests directory to try all the tests:
       
       % run_tests.sh

       If you are using ACE as a DLL, you will need to modify your PATH
       variable as explained [122]above.
       You may want to check $ACE_ROOT/tests/README for the status of the
       various tests on Mingw and the different Windows flavors.
       _________________________________
       
    Building and Installing ACE on VxWorks
       For the most part, you should be able to follow the instructions
       above to build ACE and applications that use it. Start with the
       [123]Unix instructions above to build ACE and the applications
       that use it. Please see below for more information on
       [124]building ACE on NT hosts for VxWorks targets.
       A few notes on VxWorks builds (thanks to [125]Paul von Behren for
       these notes):
          + VxWorks builds are done with a cross compiler, i.e., the
            compiles are done on a workstation creating object modules
            which are downloaded and loaded into the VxWorks target
            system.
          + C++ object modules must be post-processed by a VxWorks
            utility called "munch." ACE includes a perl script called
            [126]$ACE_ROOT/bin/ace_ld, which is called from the
            Makefiles, replacing the traditional ld step. You must have
            perl installed to use ace_ld. If perl is not on your path,
            you'll have to set PERL_PATH to the full path (including
            perl.exe), either in your
            $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU or in
            your environment.
          + Wind River provides GCC/G++ cross-compilers for the supported
            target platforms. The executables are named cc<target> and
            g++<target>; for example, ccppc and g++cpp for PowerPC
            targets.
       You'll have to let ACE know the target type at compile time. There
       are several ways to do this; please see the
       $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU platform
       file for detailed information.
       The VxWorks platform_vxworks*.GNU files are set up so that shared
       libraries are not built on VxWorks, by default. Only static
       libraries, with .a extension, are built. Therefore, it's not
       necessary to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on your
       host system when building for VxWorks targets. Please note,
       however, if you use TAO on VxWorks that you will need to set your
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find the TAO IDL compiler libraries (installed
       in the ace directory) on the host.
       With g++, $ACE_ROOT/bin/ace_ld is used to munch object files and
       libraries to set up calls to static constructors and destructors.
       bin/ace_ld requires perl on the host platform.
       These non-default VxWorks kernel configuration #defines are
       required with ACE:

#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
   For completeness, here are the non-default #defines that we used for
       VxWorks 5.3.1/g++ 2.7.2:

#define INCLUDE_CPLUS           /* include C++ support */
#define INCLUDE_CPLUS_IOSTREAMS /* include iostreams classes */
#define INCLUDE_CONFIGURATION_5_2 /* pre-tornado tools */
#define INCLUDE_DEBUG           /* pre-tornado debugging */
#define INCLUDE_LOADER          /* object module loading */
#define INCLUDE_NET_SYM_TBL     /* load symbol table from network */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL_SYNC    /* synchronize host and target symbol tables */
#define INCLUDE_NFS             /* nfs package */
#define INCLUDE_PING            /* ping() utility */
#define INCLUDE_POSIX_ALL       /* include all available POSIX functions */
#define INCLUDE_RDB             /* remote debugging package */
#define INCLUDE_RLOGIN          /* remote login */
#define INCLUDE_RPC             /* rpc package */
#define INCLUDE_SECURITY        /* shell security for network access */
#define INCLUDE_SHELL           /* interactive c-expression interpreter */
#define INCLUDE_SHOW_ROUTINES   /* show routines for system facilities*/
#define INCLUDE_SPY             /* spyLib for task monitoring */
#define INCLUDE_STARTUP_SCRIPT  /* execute start-up script */
#define INCLUDE_STAT_SYM_TBL    /* create user-readable error status */
#define INCLUDE_SYM_TBL         /* symbol table package */
#define INCLUDE_UNLOADER        /* object module unloading */
#define INCLUDE_WINDVIEW        /* WindView command server */
   Also, automatic construction/destruction of static objects should be
       enabled.
       If you use TAO, it's also a good idea to increase the NUM_FILES
       parameter from its default of 50 to, say, 1000.
       Please note that those VxWorks kernel configuration parameters are
       set in the VxWorks configAll.h file. You must rebuild your VxWorks
       kernel after modifying that file.
       If you're first getting started with ACE and/or VxWorks, I
       recommend just building the ACE library and tests first. (Some of
       the ACE examples, in System_V_IPC, don't build on VxWorks yet.)
       Then try running the tests. Please see $ACE_ROOT/tests/README for
       the latest status of the ACE tests on VxWorks.
       Please note that the main entry point is renamed to ace_main
       (configurable via ACE_MAIN) on VxWorks with g++, to comply with
       its restriction against using main. In addition,
       ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER is enabled by default to cleanly
       support construction and destruction of static objects. Please see
       the [127]Non-static ACE_Object_Manager discussion for the
       important implication of this feature.
       ACE threads (VxWorks tasks) can be named, for example, by
       supplying a non-null argument to the Thread_Manager spawn
       routines. However, names beginning with "==ace_t==" are forbidden
       because that prefix is used internally by ACE.
       You can spawn a new task to run ace_main, using either VxWorks sp,
       or ACE'S spa. spa can be used from the VxWorks shell to pass
       arguments to ace_main. Its usage is:

spa ace_main, "arg1" [, ...]
   All arguments must be quoted, even numbers.
       The ACE [128]tests write their output files in a directory named
       log/, below the current (tests) directory. If you don't have NFS
       included in your VxWorks kernel, you can use these steps, provided
       by [129]Clarence M. Weaver, to run the tests and capture their
       output:
         1. What I did was create a log directory on the boot NT host of
            my vxworks target.
         2. I copied all the test applications and the run_tests.vxworks
            script to the parent of the log directory.
         3. Using the target shell not the host shell, I "cd" to the
            directory containing the script and test programs.
         4. Invoked the script < run_tests.vxworks from this target
            shell.
       [130]Kirk Davies provided this approach for running the ACE tests
       on Tornado II:
          + Under Tornado II, I set up the Target Server File System
            (TSFS), and the test logs get written to the log subdirectory
            under that.
          + You have to set an environment variable before running the
            tests:

putenv("ACE_TEST_DIR=/tgtsvr")
       
      Building Shared Libraries for VxWorks.
       ACE supports shared libraries for VxWorks, but only with the g++
       compiler. To build shared libraries instead of the default static
       libraries, added shared_libs=1 (not shared_libs_only=1) to either
       your ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU or your
       make invocation. Then, be sure to load the ACE (and any other)
       shared library before loading your executable(s).
       A shared library for VxWorks uses the same code as for a static
       (non-shared) library. However, calls to static constructors/
       destructors are added. The code in the shared library must be
       reentrant if you shared it between programs (tasks). The ACE
       library meets this requirement.
       Shared libraries reduce build time, executable size, and load time
       of the executable. But, you must manually load the shared library
       before loading your executable(s) with a command such as:

-> ld < libACE.so
   Shared libraries can be unloaded the same way an executable (module)
       is unloaded.
       NOTE: Shared libraries on VxWorks aren't the same as shared
       libraries on other operating systems. In particular, there is no
       support for creating copies of writeable global (static) data in
       the shared library. This includes the singleton ACE_Object_Manager
       instance pointer. If you share global data between separate
       programs, they may not work properly. See the discussion of shared
       code and reentrancy in the VxWorks' Programmers Guide.
       Instead of trying to run separate programs onto a VxWorks target,
       we recommend creating just one program, and spawning a thread for
       each task. The TAO IDL_Cubit test [131]collocation test is a good
       example.
       
      Linking ACE and/or TAO Libraries into the VxWorks Kernel.
       It's easy to link your ACE and/or TAO libraries into the VxWorks
       kernel. Just build [132]shared versions, but disable the munch
       step. The easiest way to do that is to set the LD make variable to
       the name of your linker. For example, to build a libACE.so for
       PowerPC that can be linked into the kernel:

% cd $ACE_ROOT/ace
% make LD=ldppc shared_libs=1
   After building the shared lib, link it into the kernel by setting the
       MACH_EXTRA make variable in the kernel configuration Makefile.
       Then, build the kernel using make exe.
       
      Building ACE on Tornado/NT hosts for VxWorks targets.
       The following, very useful information was contributed by
       [133]Chris Ryan and [134]Paul von Behren. Please submit
       corrections, additions, or clarifications to the the [135]ACE
       mailing list.
       NOTE:The make (version 3.74) that is provided with Tornado II
       cannot be used to build ACE. Use Cygnus' make (version 3.75)
       instead.)
       NOTE:Optimization is enabled be default in
       [136]platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU. However, the compiler that is
       shipped with Tornado II has trouble compiling some files with -O2.
       To disable optimization for an individual file, just add
       optimize=0 to your make invocation when compiling that file.
       Using the Cygnus tools, this approach works:
          + You'll build both your NT and VxWorks executables in the same
            workspace (directory hierarchy). This works because the NT
            compiler and ACE's Makefiles put their output in different
            directories.
          + Set up your
            ACE_wrappers/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU as usual
            for VxWorks. See [137]the g++/VxWorks platform file for more
            information.
          + Create an ACE_wrappers/ace/config.h file that looks something
            like the following. tao_idl should be built to not support
            native exception handling, because that's not available on
            VxWorks.

#if defined (_MSC_VER)  ||  defined (__BORLANDC__)
# include "ace/config-win32.h"
# undef ACE_HAS_EXCEPTIONS
#else
# include "ace/config-vxworks.h"
#endif
          + Set your ACE_ROOT, CPP_LOCATION, WIND_BASE, and
            WIND_HOST_TYPE environment variables.
          + Build for NT, then build for VxWorks.
       A few additional Windows Notes, from Paul von Behren:
          + Cygnus has created a Win32 API which is compatible with a
            "generic" Unix environment. Using this library, they have
            ported a large collection of GNU tools to WinNT/95 -
            including a port of gcc/g++. See
            [138]http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/ A related link is
            [139]ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/
          + To set up the command-prompt build environemnt, run
            Tornado\host\x86-win32\bin\TorVars.bat. This is done
            implicitly within the Tornado IDE.
          + To run ace_ld, you still need perl installed - see
            [140]http://www.activestate.com/software/default.htm for
            Windows perl.
          + The Tornado IDE will use a standard Makefile for project
            builds, but does not have a GUI interface for managing the
            Makefile. By default, it will use rules from Makefile in the
            current directory and you can configure it to add certain
            Makefile targets to the project. If you have ACE_ROOT defined
            before starting Tornado, you can specify an ACE Makefile as a
            Tornado target and Tornado will then call make from the menu.
       And Chris Ryan's instructions for building for VxWorks targets on
       Windows NT hosts:
         1. Path setting that seems to be working is:

      /tornado/host/x86-win32/bin:
      /tornado/host/x86-win32/lib/gcc-lib/i386-wrs-vxworks/cygnus-2.7.2-960126:
      /tornado/host/x86-win32/i386-wrs-vxworks/bin:
      /ace/ace_wrappers/bin:
      /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin:
      /gnuwin32/b18/tcl/bin:
      /WINNT/system32:
      /WINNT:
      /WINNT/system32/nls/ENGLISH:
      /bin

        Other environment variables:

      WIND_BASE=/tornado
      SHELL=/bin/sh.exe
      TERM=pcbios
      TAO_ROOT=/ace/ACE_wrappers.vxworks/TAO
      CPP_LOCATION=/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.EXE
      GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=/tornado/host/x86-win32/lib/gcc-lib/
      WIND_HOST_TYPE=x86-win32
      ACE_ROOT=/ace/ACE_wrappers.vxworks

         2. /tornado is the root of the Tornado install ($WIND_BASE).
         3. /gnuwin32 is the root of a Cygnus GNU download and install.
         4. /bin content is:

      aced.dll
      cygwin.dll
      perl.exe
      rm.exe
      sh.exe
      true

        aced.dll is produced in an ACE NT source tree according to
            documented procedure for NT VC++5.0 ACE build. cygwin.dll is
            from the Cygnus GNU software download and install.
         5. Basically, follow documented procedure for ACE build/install
            on UNIX platform. Create a $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h that looks
            like:

      #include "config-vxworks5.x.h"

        And create a $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU
            that looks like:

      WIND_BASE = /tornado
      WIND_HOST_TYPE = x86-win32
      CPU = I80486
      include $(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_vxworks5.x_g++.GNU

         6. When using cygnus windows GNUTools on WinNT you have to start
            make with "--unix" option, otherwise WinNT shell cmd.exe is
            responded and not sh.exe, i.e.,

 make --unix static_libs=1

      TAO on NT Tornado host, VxWorks target.
         1. Build ACE and TAO_IDL in the NT tree as already documented.
            As mentioned above, I put aced.dll in /bin. Be sure to build
            ACE's gperf on NT, in ACE_wrappers/apps/gperf/src.
         2. Build $TAO_ROOT/tao

      CPP_LOCATION=/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.exe
      cd $TAO_ROOT/tao
      /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/make

         3. Build orbsvcs.
      CPP_LOCATION=/Program Files/DevStudio/VC/bin/CL.exe
      cd $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
      /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/make

         4. Build $TAO_ROOT/tests
       
      [141]Jaffar Shaikh's Notes for Building ACE and TAO for VxWorks on NT
    host
       Scenario: I was building the ACE and TAO for VxWorks = on NT. The
       target system was a PPC860 based chassis and another a NT = host
       based card.
       Host System:
       NT 4.0 workstation with 128 M RAM, 266MHz Pentium.
       Software Needed For Building TAO
       1) PERL: Active State's ActivePerl 5.6.0.618 for NT available as =
       freeware from =

       xe =
       2) Tornado II .Release V 9904 from Windriver.
       3) Cygwin GNU to build TAO. It is available for NT as a freeware =
       from
       http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/
       The Cygwin Make (version 3.75) can only build the TAO not the =
       Tornado II make (version 3.74)
       Environment Variables:
       On NT the environment Variables are set as follows, (from =
       Control Panel-> System -> Environment)
       I added following Environment variable entries to PATH

       ACE_COMPONENTS=FOR_TAO (you may choose this option to build ACE =
       library that supports TAO)
       
       Steps to Build
       1) Build Ace.dll under NT
       In MS Visual C++ open C:\Corba\ACE_wrappers\ace.dsw And build Ace
       = DLL
       Copy Ace.dll in C:\bin
       2) Build gperf utility under NT
       In MS Visual C++ open =
       C:\Corba\ACE_wrappers\apps\gperf\src\gperf.dsw. Build gperf.exe
       Copy gperf.exe to C:\bin
       3) Mount Directries in Cygwin
       Click on Cygnus Solutions -> Cygwin Bash Shell
       Mount following directories by using mount command.
       create respective directories first then use mount command
       e.g. Create /Corba directory then use $mount -s "C:\Corba" =
       /Corba
       C:\Corba mount to /Corba
       C:\tornado mount to /tornado
       C:\Perl mount to /perl
       C:\Cygwin mount to /cygwin
       C:\bin mount to /bin
       C:\Program Files mount to /Program Files
       4) Build ACE in Cygwin
       $cd /Corba/ACE_wrappers/ace
       $make static_libs=1
       This will build your ace library libACE.a for VxWorks. If you use
       = option shared_libs=1 then the build will be libACE.so. The other
       = options are same as follows.
       5) Build TAO in Cygwin
       $cd $TAO_ROOT/tao
       $make debug=0 optimize=1 static_libs_only=1 minimum_orb=1 =
       for shared libs use shared_libs=1
       The minimum Tao does not have following components,
       Dynamic Skeleton Interface
       Dynamic Invocation Interface
       Dynamic Any
       Interceptors
       Interface Repository
       Advanced POA features
       CORBA/COM interworking
       You may play around with above options to find suitable build for
       = your needs. For example when you give option debug=1 all the
       debug = symbols will be created and the build will huge in size.
       The debug = symbols are necessary when you want to debug your
       code.

  Building and Installing ACE Network Services
       The following explains how to build the ACE [142]network services
       on [143]UNIX and [144]Win32.
       _________________________________
       
    Building and Installing ACE Network Services on UNIX
       Building and installing ACE Network Services on UNIX is relatively
       simple (the [145]process for Win32 is different). Here's what you
       need to do:
         1. Build and install ACE on UNIX as described [146]earlier. If
            ACE is built at the root of the ACE source tree (and ACE has
            been ported to your platform, of course) the netsvcs static
            and shared object libraries should be built automatically. In
            addition, the server driver program (main) contained in
            [147]$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/main.cpp should also be
            compiled and ready to run.
         2. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to where the
            binary version of the ACE netsvcs library. For example, you
            probably want to do something like the following

      % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

         3. By default, if the shared object library is built, the
            services are linked into the main driver program dynamically.
            To specify which services should be linked in and executed,
            edit the [148]$ACE_ROOT/netsvcs/servers/svc.conf file. During
            your editing, you should update information (such as the
            default service port numbers) that affects the initialization
            of services in this file. Refer to the [149]Service
            Configurator documentation to learn how the configuration
            file is parsed and how the services are dynamically linked
            and executed. In addition, refer to the [150]Network Services
            documentation to learn more about how to configure each
            network service.
         4. If you only want to link the services statically, simply
            remove or rename the svc.conf file.

  What Do I Need to Build for TAO?
       Toshio Hori <toshi@etl.go.jp> provided these suggestions on
       building just what's needed for (a subset of) TAO:
       I usually make:

    $ACE_ROOT/ace,
    $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf,
    $TAO_ROOT/tao,
    $TAO_ROOT/TAO_IDL, and
    $TAO_ROOT/orbsvcs/orbsvcs
   and the whole make takes less than an hour on my Solaris 7 for intel,
       Pentium-III/550MHz, 256MB memory, 512MB swap machine. (Top secret:
       I renice the 'make' process to the highest priority, -20... ;-) To
       save time and space, I set

    TAO_ORBSVCS = Naming Time Trader ImplRepo
   in $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU also. See
       [151]TAO's orbsvcs library customization instructions for more
       information.
         _____________________________________________________________
       
  System Resource Requirements
       The amount of system resources required to build ACE and TAO
       varies greatly. Platform, build options, and components built
       primarily influence the required system resources. As a rough
       guide, the typical peak memory requirement could be well over 256
       Mb (notably, for TAO's orbsvcs). An entire build of ACE and TAO
       can use well over 1300 Mb of disk space. It's usually not
       necessary to build all of ACE and TAO, though.
       Much less disk space is required for just the libraries. For
       example, see the [152]ACE library subset sizes.
       If you run out of memory when building, you might consider trying
       some or all of these suggestions:
          + Enable or increase virtual memory. If you're on a [153]Linux
            or [154]LynxOS platform, please see the appropriate sections
            above.
          + Disable/enable optimization and/or debugging. See the
            [155]Makefile Flags discussion for information on how to do
            that via ACE's Makefiles.
          + If you're using g++, try removing -pipe from CFLAGS in your
            include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU file.
          + Restrict the components that you build. For ACE and TAO, see
            the discussion of ACE_COMPONENTS in the [156]ACE subsets
            page. For TAO's orbsvcs, see the discussion of TAO_ORBSVCS in
            [157]orbsvcs Library configuration information.
            If disk space is a problem, disabling debugging should
            greatly reduce object code, and therefore, library size. This
            is especially true with g++.
            Toshio Hori <toshi@etl.go.jp> provided these tips for
            reducing disk space usage:
            To save space on a Unix machine, I usually run 'find . -name
            \*.dsw -o -name \*.dsp -o -name \*.bor | xargs rm -f' in
            $ACE_ROOT at first after I untar the distribution. They are
            meaningless in my environment (Files named '*.dsw' and
            '*.dsp' are used for MSVC++ and files named '*.bor' are for
            Borland C++ Builder.)
            Finally, to save space, may want to run 'make clean' after
            'make'. It removes generated object files and leaves
            libraries/exectables intact.

    Non-static ACE_Object_Manager
       The ACE_Object_Manager can be instantiated as a static object, can
       be instantiated on the stack of the main program thread, or can be
       explicitly instantiated and destroyed by the application with
       ACE::init () and ACE::fini (). The comments in the [168]header
       file, ace/Object_Manager.h provide more detail.
       NOTE: Special requirements are imposed on applications if the
       ACE_Object_Manager is instantiated, by ACE, on the stack of the
       main thread. This behavior is selected by defining
       ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER in ace/config.h. Again, see the
       ACE Object_Manager [169]header file, ace/Object_Manager.h for more
       information. One of these requirements is discussed here, because
       it is so important. Please note that
       ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER is defined in the distributed ACE
       config.h headers for VxWorks and Win32.
       The important requirement is that the program must declare its
       main function with two arguments, even if they're not used, and
       with int return type:

int
main (int, char *[])
   If you don't declare main exactly that way, then you'll see a link
       error about ace_main_i being undefined.
       Alternatively, this feature can be disabled by commenting out the
       #define ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER in the ace/config.h. But,
       that will make repeated testing more difficult on VxWorks. And,
       you'd either have to call static constructors and destructors
       manually or unload/load the program between runs. On Win32,
       disabling the feature can possibly lead to shutdown difficulties.
       WARNING: ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER assumes that your main
       function is named main. Any violation of this assumption is at
       your peril. If you really need to call your entry point something
       other than main, you'll need to construct and destroy the
       ACE_Object_Manager. The best way to do that is to call ACE::init
       () and ACE::fini (). Or, see the #define of main (int, char *[])
       in [170]ace/OS.h to see how ACE does that for entry points named
       main.
       _________________________________
       
    Cloning the Source Tree
       On UNIX platforms, we typically like to support multiple platform
       builds using the same ACE source tree. This idiom is supported by
       ACE using the $ACE_ROOT/bin/create_ace_build script or
       $ACE_ROOT/bin/clone.cpp program. To use build and use the clone
       program, first make sure there's a file called platform_macros.GNU
       that contains the correct platform-specific Makefile
       configurations in the $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/ directory, as
       well as making sure there's a $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h file that
       includes the desired platform/compiler specific configuration
       header. Then perform the following steps:

% cd $ACE_ROOT/bin
% make
% mv clone ~/bin
% rehash
       Then create a ./build subdirectory someplace, e.g., under
       $ACE_ROOT. Once this is done, then invoke the top-level Makefile
       with the "clone" target, e.g.:

% cd $ACE_ROOT
% mkdir build-SunOS5
% cd build-SunOS5
% make -f ../Makefile clone
% setenv ACE_ROOT $cwd
% make
       This will establish a complete tree of links. In addition, make
       sure you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
       $ACE_ROOT/ace:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH on SVR4 UNIX platforms.
       When you do a make in the $ACE_ROOT directory you will be
       producing object code that is not stored in the same place as the
       original source tree. This way, you can easily build another
       platform in a parallel tree structure.
       VERY IMPORTANT! 
       If you use the "clone trick" discussed above, make sure that the
       symbolic links are correctly in place before starting the build.
       In particular, if you plan to clone the tree, it is preferable to
       do so before you start a build procedure on the original tree.
       This is because the build procedure create object directories
       (.obj and .shobj) and the cloning procedure will clone these
       directories also. You would end up with links pointing to object
       files of another platform. If you clone the tree after you've done
       a build on the original tree, make sure to remove all ".obj",
       ".shobj" and (any other files or directories) in all
       subdirectories before starting the build on your cloned tree.
       Alternatively, the perl script ACE_wrappers/bin/create_ace_build
       can be used to create build trees. It creates them below
       ACE_wrappers/build. It filters out all but the necessary files, so
       the warning above does not apply. See the comments at the top of
       the script itself for usage information.
       _________________________________
       
    Building CORBA Versions of ACE
       Note that if you are compiling with IONA's Orbix implementation of
       CORBA or Visigenix's implementation of CORBA, you'll also need to
       set ORBIX_ROOT to point to the root of the Orbix source tree and
       ORBELINE_ROOT to point to the root of the ORBeline source tree.
       Since many platforms don't have these CORBA tools the default for
       ACE does *not* incorporate them. Thus, if you are compiling with
       Orbix or ORBeline, make sure that you set up
       $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU and
       $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h to use the config* and platform* files that
       have "-orbix" in them!
       _________________________________
       
    Additional Build Tips for MVS
       For all intents and purpose, MVS OpenEdition (OE) is another
       flavor of UNIX, therefore, the instructions under [171]Building
       and Installing ACE on Unix can be used along with the following
       additional tips:
       You can get a copy of GNU make that has been ported to MVS
       OpenEdition from the [172]IBM OpenEdition web site. ACE's make
       scheme generates compile commands that have options and operands
       interspersed. By default, the c89/cc/c++ compiler expects all
       options to precede all operands. To get around this, you must set
       a special compiler environment variable (_CXX_CCMODE) to 1 which
       tells the compiler to allow options and operands to be
       interspersed.
       Note that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is called
       LIBPATH on MVS.
       Shared objects are built a little different on MVS than on other
       UNIX implementations. This has been accounted for in the makefiles
       that come with ACE When the linker (via the cxx command) builds
       the libACE.so file it will also create a file called libACE.x.
       This is a side-deck file and it must be included in subsequent
       link edits with application code. For more information on this see
       the C/C++ MVS Programming Guide. If you want to build your
       application statically, i.e., using libACE.a instead of libACE.so,
       you can set ACELIB to ACELIB_STATIC in platform_mvs.GNU.
       When the libACE.so file is built (via the MVS pre-linker and
       binder), you will get a rc=4 from the pre-linker. This is ok. This
       is due to some warnings about unresolved references which should
       get resolved during the link step. Note, however, there shouldn't
       be any unresolved references from the binder (linkage editor). You
       can get pre-link and link maps by uncommenting the PMAP and LMAP
       lines in the platform_mvs.GNU file.
       _________________________________
       
    Makefile Flags
       GNU make provides many options to customize its operation. See its
       documentation for more information. One example is that for
       multi-cpu UNIX machines you will be able to build faster if you
       use:

% make -j n
       which allows parallel compilation. The number n should typically
       be the number of CPUs. It is likely that builds will be faster
       even on single-CPU UNIX machines with make -j 2.
       ACE further supports the following flags. They can be enabled
       either on the command line, e.g., "make purify=1", or added to
       your platform_macros.GNU. To disable the option, set the flag to
       null, e.g., "make debug=". Some flags support setting to 0
       disable, e.g., "make debug=0". debug=1 is enabled in the platform
       files that are released with ACE.
       Please note that the effects of a flag may be platform specific.
       Also, combinations of certain flags may or may not be allowed on
       specific platforms, e.g., debug=1 opt=1 is supported by g++ but
       not all other C++ compilers.
       If you use Purify or Quantify: purify or quantify must be on your
       PATH. By default, ACE puts the Purify/Quantify caches below /tmp.
       To override that, set the PURE_CACHE_BASE_DIR variable, either in
       your environment or on the make make command line, to the
       destination directory for your instrumented libraries.

Flag             Description

exceptions       Enable exception handling (not supported by all platforms).
fast             Enable -fast option, e.g., with Sun C++.
inline           Enable ACE inlining.  Some platforms enable inlining by
                   default, others do not.

quantify         Quantify all executables.
repo             Use GNU template repository (g++ with repo patches and
                   egcs only).
rtti             Enable run-time type identification.  On some platforms,
                   it is enabled by default, so this is ignored.
shared_libs      Build shared libraries. Ignored if static_libs_only is set.
static_libs      Build shared libraries. Ignored if shared_libs_only is set.
shared_libs_only Only build shared libraries.  Ignored if no SHLIBs are
                   specified by the Makefile, as in performance-tests/Misc.
static_libs_only Only build static libraries.
threads          Build with thread support.
xt_reactor       Build the XtReactor.

Usually, users do not need to be concerned with make targets.
Just enter "make" on the command line to build.  A few notable
targets are listed below.

Target             Description
------             -----------
show_statics       Lists all static objects in object files built for
                     current directory.  Only supported for g++.
