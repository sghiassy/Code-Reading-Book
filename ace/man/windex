ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Transmit_File_Result	ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Transmit_File_Result (3)   - This class implements ACE_Asynch_Transmit_File::Result for WIN32 platforms. 
ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Write_Dgram	ACE_WIN32_Asynch_Write_Dgram (3)    - This class is a factory for starting off asynchronous writes on a UDP socket.

ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr		ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr (3)	- This class implements support for a weak pointer that complements ACE_Strong_Bound_Ptr. Unlike ACE_Strong_Bound_Ptr, assigning or copying instances of an ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr will not automatically increment the reference count of the underlying object. What ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr does is preserve the knowledge that the object is in fact reference counted, and thus provides an alternative to raw pointers where non-ownership associations must be maintained. When the last instance of an ACE_Strong_Bound_Ptr that references a particular object is destroyed or overwritten, the corresponding ACE_Weak_Bound_Ptr instances are set to null. 
ACE_Write_Guard ACE_Write_Guard (3) - This class is similar to class , though it acquires/releases a write lock automatically (naturally, the  it is instantiated with must support the appropriate API).
