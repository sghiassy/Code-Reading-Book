.SS ACE_DEV_Connector::ACE_DEV_Connector (void)
.PP
Default constructor.

.SS ACE_DEV_Connector::ACE_DEV_Connector (\fBACE_DEV_IO\fR & new_io, const \fBACE_DEV_Addr\fR & remote_sap, \fBACE_Time_Value\fR * timeout = 0, const \fBACE_Addr\fR & local_sap = \fBACE_Addr::sap_any\fR, int reuse_addr = 0, int flags = O_RDWR, int perms = 0)
.PP
Actively connect and produce a <new_stream> if things go well. The <remote_sap> is the address that we are trying to connect with. The <timeout> is the amount of time to wait to connect. If it's 0 then we block indefinitely. If *timeout == {0, 0} then the connection is done using non-blocking mode. In this case, if the connection can't be made immediately the value of -1 is returned with <errno == EWOULDBLOCK>. If *timeout > {0, 0} then this is the maximum amount of time to wait before timing out. If the time expires before the connection is made <errno == ETIME>. The <local_sap> is the value of local address to bind to. If it's the default value of  then the user is letting the OS do the binding. If <reuse_addr> == 1 then the <local_addr> is reused, even if it hasn't been cleanedup yet. The <flags> and <perms> arguments are passed down to the <open> method.
