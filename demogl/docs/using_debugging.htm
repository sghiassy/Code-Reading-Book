<h4>Debugging an application or screensaver.</h4>
Every application has bugs, especially after the first compile. Some bugs are easily tracked down
and fixed, others are very hard to find. DemoGL provides debug functionality for the developer to
make it easier to track down application bugs, especially in release-builds, where the compiler debugger
will not help much.
<p>
DemoGL normally doesn't log that much information when starting up or when some event occurs. This can be
switched off by setting the quickboot variable, DGL_VF_QUICKBOOT, to false, using 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SetVariable.htm">DEMOGL_SetVariable</a>. The bootphase of an application will
take longer on slow machines but a lot more information is logged on the console. Also when TLE's are executed
or other events occur, they are logged on the console. Errors are always logged on the console, with or without
having DGL_VF_QUICKBOOT set to false.
<p>
From application code, developers can log runtime information on the console by calling
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLine.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLine</a> or it's variable argument variant:
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV</a>. DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLine is a little
faster than DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV, but has the single string restriction. DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV works as
printf and is a very flexible solution to log runtime variable contents.
<p>
Set the console buffer size to a large number. Default the buffer contains 500 lines, but DemoGL logs a lot of info
so consider if that is enough. If not, change it with <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance</a>
where you can also change the number of lines in the debug overlay.
<p>
Use the keys F2-F7 to list information about the current running application. To show the real frames per second, press
F2 to enable that overlay. You can also enable that overlay by default by setting DGL_VF_SHOWFPS to true. To show the
list of currently created layers, visible and hidden, plus the effects on those layers, press F3. This can be handy when
effects dissapear while they shouldn't: an effectobject is started on a layer that contained already an effect. Press F4
to list all registered effects with their names known by DemoGL. This is important because objectnames are case sensitive.
If TLE's don't behave as planned, use F7 to list the current timeline and all TLE's on it, if they're executed, the current
timespot on the timeline, all TLE's commands, objectnames and parameters.
<p>
To start and stop effects during runtime, use the input prompt. This prompt can be enabled by enabling the debug overlay
by pressing F5 first and then enable the input prompt by pressing F6. To execute a TLE, simply type it on the input prompt
with out the timespot parameter and press ENTER. The TLE will be executed immediately. This way, the designer can test
which effects to place on which layers and if the developer has added variable support to the Receive*() methods in
the effectclasses, the designer can send parameters to the effects at runtime to check and test what is best.
<p>
When developing a screensaver, it's wise to first build it as a normal application, so it won't exit when a key is pressed.
Then when it runs ok, it can be modified to act as a screensaver. Because DemoGL will take care of all the screensaver
specific stuff, your application will run as planned when ran as a screensaver if it ran as planned in the form of an
application. Don't forget to add a RESTART command TLE at the end of the script when creating a multipart screensaver.
