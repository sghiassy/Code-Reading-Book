<h4>Using nongraphical effects for tricks and application management.</h4>
Every effectclass that is placed on a visible layer is executed. Which in fact means: its RenderFrame or RenderFrameEx
method is called every cycle. Because all layers are executed from the lowest layer number to the highest layer number, to
get an effect object executed before every other effect objects is easy, just place it on a layer with a number lower than
all the layers with the other effectobjects. This way it's easy to use this feature to execute certain logic that has to
be executed every time a new cycle starts, for example clearing a buffer.
<p>
Clearing the framebuffer and backbuffer in a nongraphical effect is an example of how to perform a task, that has to be
done every cycle, but shouldn't be tied to an effect that isn't running all the time. DemoGL will not clear any buffers
because this is not needed in every situation, thus clearing some buffer in DemoGL would limit the usage of the library.
It however does implicitly force a task on the developer to make sure the framebuffer and other buffers in OpenGL are
cleared when needed. Below is the CControl class that will clear the frame and / or depthbuffer every time its RenderFrame
method is called. Because it has build in logic to react on received parameters, it's easy to control it at runtime by
setting its runtime parameters using a TLE from the script or a TLE using the function 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ExecuteCommand.htm">DEMOGL_ExecuteCommand</a>, which will execute a received TLE (without the
timespot parameter) immediately. 
<pre>
// CControl.h, control effect class for buffer clearing.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#ifndef _CCONTROL_H
#define _CCONTROL_H

#include	&quot;DemoGL_Effect.h&quot;

class CControl:public CEffect
{
	// Public functions
	public:
			CControl(void);
		virtual	~CControl(void);
		void	RenderFrame(long lElapsedTime);
		int	Init(int iWidth, int iHeight);
		void	ReceiveInt(char *pszName, int iParam, long lLayer);

	private:
		GLuint	m_iBufferBits;
};
#endif 
</pre>
The class definition is very small, since we only need an Init() method, a ReceiveInt() method and
a RenderFrame method. The class implementation itself is below:
<pre>
// CControl.cpp. Implementation of CControl class, see CControl.h
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt;

#include &quot;DemoGL_DLL.h&quot;
#include &quot;CControl.h&quot;

// Purpose: constructor
CControl::CControl()
{
}

// Purpose: destructor
CControl::~CControl()
{
}

// Purpose: Init method implementation. Called during
// application startup.
int
CControl::Init(int iWidth, int iHeight)
{
	// default colorbuffer clear is ON and DEPTHbuffer clear
	// is on.
	m_iBufferBits = GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT | GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT;
	return SYS_OK;
}


// Purpose: ReceiveInt method implementation. is called
// every time a SENDINT TLE is executed. It ignores lLayer so
// all values will have the same effect.
void
CControl::ReceiveInt(char *pszName, int iParam, long lLayer)
{
	if(!strcmp(pszName,&quot;COLORBUFFER&quot;))
	{
		// set colorbuffer bit to new value, stored in iParam.
		if(iParam)
		{
			// set to on.
			m_iBufferBits |= GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT;
		}
		else
		{
			// set to off
			m_iBufferBits ^= GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT;
		}
		return;
	}
	if(!strcmp(pszName,&quot;DEPTHBUFFER&quot;))
	{
		// set depthbuffer bit to new value, stored in iParam
		if(iParam)
		{
			// set to on.
			m_iBufferBits |= GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT;
		}
		else
		{
			// set to off
			m_iBufferBits ^= GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT;
		}
		return;
	}
}


// Purpose: implementation of the RenderFrame method. Gets called
// every cycle when CControl effect is placed on a visible layer.
void
CControl::RenderFrame(long lElapsedTime)
{
	glClearColor(0.0f,0.0f,0.0f,1.0f);
	glClear(m_iBufferBits);
}
</pre>
This class will react on TLE's that execute the SENDINT command with this object and use parameter names
'COLORBUFFER' and 'DEPTHBUFFER'. To swich off depth buffer clearing at runtime, say after 10 seconds, 
this TLE will do that: (assuming the object (instance of) CControl is registered with DemoGL using the name CONTROL
and the CONTROL object is started on a layer, say layer 0)
<pre>
10000;CONTROL;SENDINT;DEPTHBUFFER;0;0;
</pre>
It will send a 0 to the CONTROL object and the name of that value is 'DEPTHBUFFER'. The layernumber is 0, but CControl
will ignore that value anyway, all layernumbers will do. The TLE could also have been executed from code, from any other
effect object.
<pre>
DEMOGL_ExecuteCommand(&quot;CONTROL;SENDINT;DEPTHBUFFER;0;0;&quot;);
</pre>
The power of this solution is in the re-usability of the CControl class. No effect class has to contain buffer clearing calls,
so the developer doens't have to worry if the buffer gets cleared on time. Just place the CControl effectobject on a layer below
all other effect objects and it will get cleared, no matter which effects are running on top of it.
<p>
Other possible 'worker' effectobjects are for example effectobjects that calculate textures and upload them to DemoGL using 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureCreateFromBuffer.htm">DEMOGL_TextureCreateFromBuffer</a> and predefined pszIdentName values.
Other effectobjects just do a DEMOGL_TextureLoad() with that pszIdentName and they will receive an ID, since the texture is
already there. The texture calculator effect can then be driven by parameters from the script. The possibilities are endless.
