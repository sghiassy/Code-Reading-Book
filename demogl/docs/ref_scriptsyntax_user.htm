<h4>Effect object</h4>
Below are the definitions for all the commands which can be specified in the script with a registered effect object. You should
use the name specified when you registered the effects with <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_EffectRegister.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_EffectRegister</a>
as object name, similar to '_SOUNDSYSTEM' when specifying a command for the _SOUNDSYSTEM object
You can add as much whitespace around commands and object names in the scriptcommands as you like, these will be 
stripped off anyway. 
<p>
All the commands below are prefixed with the timeline position in milliseconds when the command should be executed.
This timeline position can be negative, which means the command is executed prior application execution. All negative timeline events
are executed at once, prior to the start of the application, in the order on the timeline, so more negative times come first.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
-100;MYEFFECT;PREPARE;
</pre>
<p>
This will make DemoGL call the Prepare() method of the object which was registered with the name 'MYEFFECT', prior to execution of the application.
<p>
Below, the effect object is referenced with 'Effectname'. You should replace that with the name of the effect object which is the target of the
command.

	<b>PREPARE</b>
<pre>
Effectname;PREPARE;
</pre>
<dd>Will make DemoGL call the Prepare() method of the effect object registered with the name 'Effectname'. 
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>START</b>
<pre>
Effectname;START;Layer number;
</pre>
<dd>DemoGL will place the effect with registered name 'Effect name' on the layer with number Layer number. When the layer does not
	exist, it will be created. When the layer exists and contains another effect, this effect will be replaced by the effect with
	name 'Effectname'. The removed effect will be stopped, but can be assigned to another layer and continue execution. Layers are
	rendered starting with the layer with the lowest number, then the layer with the next lowest number etc. Layer numbers don't have
	to be sequencial, you can specify layer 0, 10 and 10000 for example, which results in first layer 0 is rendered, then 10 and then
	10000. You can start an effect object on as many layers as you want.
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><i>Layer number</i>
	<dd>Specifies the number of the layer on which the effect should be placed.<br>
		<b>Type:</b> long. Legal values are &gt;=0.
	</dl>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>STOP</b>
<pre>
Effectname;STOP;
</pre>
<dd>The effect object registered with the name 'Effectname' will be stopped, all layers the effect is running on are removed. The effect
	stays inside DemoGL so it can be restarted later using the START command.
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>END</b>
<pre>
Effectname;END;
</pre>
<dd>As STOP but will make DemoGL also call the End() method of the effect object registered with the name 'Effectname'. The effect is, unlike STOP,
	removed from DemoGL and cannot be restarted, but should be re-registered again using <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_EffectRegister.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_EffectRegister</a>.
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>MOVETOLYR</b>
<pre>
Effectname;MOVETOLYR;Layer number;
</pre>
<dd>DemoGL will move the effect with registered name 'Effect name' to the layer with number Layer number. When that layer does not
	exist, it will be created. When the layer exists and contains another effect, this effect will be replaced by the effect with
	name 'Effectname'. The removed effect will be stopped, but can be assigned to another layer and continue execution. 
	The layer where the effect was running on is removed.
	Layers are rendered starting with the layer with the lowest number, then the layer with the next lowest number etc. Layer numbers don't have
	to be sequencial, you can specify layer 0, 10 and 10000 for example, which results in first layer 0 is rendered, then 10 and then
	10000.

	<b>SEND</b>
<pre>
Effectname;SEND;value to send;
</pre>
<dd><b>Deprecated command. Do not use.</b> DemoGL will call the ReceiveParam() method of the effect object registered with the name 'Effectname', passing
