<h4>The script.</h4>
The script, or application script, contains the specification of what will happen when during application execution. 
When the developer creates effectobjects (instances) of the effectclasses and 
<a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_EffectRegister.htm">registers</a> them with DemoGL before
the control is <a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">passed to DemoGL</a>, nothing is done with the effectobjects to
make them get executed. When the control is passed to DemoGL using <a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a>,
the screen will stay black and no sound will be played, until a <i>Timeline Event (TLE)</i> occurs. A TLE is a definition
of an action DemoGL should perform on a certain point in time. This point in time is defined on a timeline, which 
starts when the application starts it's execution, which is when DemoGL is done initializing after 
<a href="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> is called and ready to execute the effects and play the
sounds. The timeline starts at 0.0 milliseconds. A TLE is defined with a line in the application script, so the
application script is in fact a collection of TLE definitions. 
<p>
A TLE can have a positive (which will take place after execution starts) timespot on the timeline or a negative 
(which will take place before execution starts) timespot on the timeline. It's wise to define pre-execution
actions with negative timespots so your application is ready to roll when execution starts. 
<p>
A TLE has the following common syntax:
<pre>
	timespot;objectname;command;[parameter1;...parameter64;]
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt><i>Timespot</i>
	<dd>This is the timespot on the timeline when the TLE should be executed. Timespot is in milliseconds and is
		defined as long, so no fraction is accepted.
	<dt><i>objectname</i>
	<dd>This is the name (case sensitive) of the object on which <i>command</i> has effect. This can be one of the
		predefined DemoGL objects: _SOUNDSYSTEM and _SYSTEM, or the name of an effectobject defined by the developer.
	<dt><i>command</i>
	<dd>This is the command that should be executed on <i>objectname</i>. 
	<dt><i>parameter1 to parameter64</i>
	<dd>Some commands have parameters, some don't. See the in depth syntax descriptions of all the commands defined
		for each command's parameters. The '[' and ']' in the syntax definition above are markers for 'is optional'
		and shouldn't be placed in TLE definitions.
</dl>
<p>
The script can handle commentlines. A commentline has a '#' as the first character on a line in the script. 
As with empty lines, all commentlines are skipt by the scriptparser during the load of the script. You may add
whitespace (tabs or spaces) between the parts of a TLE and the ';' separators. DemoGL will chop off these whitespace
characters during the parsing of the application script.
<p>
All TLE's are read before execution starts, during system initialisation, and ordered in a sequential order, based
on the timespot of the TLE's. Before execution will start, DemoGL will execute all TLE's which have a timespot
that is smaller than the starttime of the application (which is normally 0.0, but execution can start at any given
timespot, so you can jump in the middle of the timeline of your application). When execution is started, each frame
DemoGL will check if there are TLE's with a timespot smaller or equal to the current time on the timeline. If there
are TLE's found, they all get executed before the frame is actually started (so no effectobjects on any layer is
called before all TLE's that have to be executed, are done). When you define a TLE that will be time consuming, for
example a <i>PREPARE</i> command with a given effectobject, this can stall application execution, so plan your TLE's
wisely.
<p>
DemoGL supports an unlimited amount of TLE's, and an unlimited amount of TLE's per timespot. When TLE's have the 
same timespot, they're stored in LIFO order (Last In First Out). Syntax checking is done during parsing of the
application script, semantic TLE checking (for example: can a certain object handle the given command) is done
during runtime. When a syntax error or semantic error is detected, the error is logged on the console and 
the TLE is ignored.
