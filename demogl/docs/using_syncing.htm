<h4>Synchronizing effectcode to music or events.</h4>
DemoGL's soundsystem has the ability to generate events when settable synchronizer objects are triggered.
These synchronizer objects can be created inside the soundsystem and work with DGL_SS_MODELEMENT sound elements.
The soundsystem will send normal windows messages to the application's messagepump when synchronizer objects
are triggered. All messages received by the application's messagepump can also be received by effectobjects.
All they have to do is enable their messagehandler method, using: 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_MessageHandlerEnable.htm">DEMOGL_MessageHandlerEnable</a> (disabled by default). 
When an effect has enabled its messagehandler method, all windows messages will be passed to that effect's
messagehandler method, CEffect's <b>MessageHandler</b>. 
<p>
To create a synchronizer object inside the soundsystem, use 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate</a>, specifying a certain
ChannelCodeID to use as the source for the synchronizer object. The channel specified must play DGL_SS_MODELEMENT
type data, otherwise the synchronizer object will not work (i.e. will never get triggered). An example of
creating a synchronizer object:
<pre>
iSyncID=DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncCreate(iModuleChannelID, 
	BASS_SYNC_MUSICINST,MAKELONG(7,-1),1);
</pre>
This will create a synchronizer object for the channel with ChannelCodeID stored in iModuleChannelID, the type
is an instrument trigger, for instrument no. 7 and all notes. The flag specified is '1', which is sent with the
message that is send when the synchronizer object gets triggered, which is in this case, when instrument 7 is played
on channel iModuleChannelID.
<p>
When a synchronizer object gets triggered, it will send a normal windows message. Besides the triggerdata, also the
flag specified when the synchronizer object was created is send with the message. This flag is now usable to 
select which synchronizer object was triggered and send this message. Below is an example how this synchronizer
just created above can be used to perform certain actions. Note: a message send due to a synchronizer is send to the
application message pump, and all messages received by the application message pump are passed through to <i>all</i> 
<b>enabled</b> MessageHandler methods of <i>all</i> effectobjects. This way it's easy to synchronize multiple effects
on just one synchronizer object.
<pre>
// Purpose: the messagehandler of this effect. if we enable it we'll receive 
// every message posted to the window of the current app. This is handy if we 
// want to receive keyboard or mouse messages or f.e. soundsystem synchronizer
// messages
void
CMyCoolEffect::MessageHandler(HWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM  wParam, LPARAM  lParam)
{
	switch(uMsg)
	{
		// ... other message handler case clauses
		
		case WM_DEMOGL_SOUNDSYSTEMSYNC:
		{
			switch(wParam)
			{
				// here 3 synchronizers are created, they are used to
				// modify rotation angles of a rotating object. 
				case 1:
				{
					m_fAlpha+=1.0f;
				}; break;
				case 2:
				{
					m_fBeta+=4.0f;
				}; break;
				case 3:
				{
					m_fGamma+=3.0f;
				}; break;
			}
		}; break;
	}
}
</pre>
The example above is very basic but you can do anything based on a received synchronizer message.
To remove a synchronizer, simply delete it using
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncDelete.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemSyncDelete</a>. It will then
not be available, and no messages will be received from this synchronizer object.
