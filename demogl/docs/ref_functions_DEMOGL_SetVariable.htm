<dt><h4>DEMOGL_SetVariable</h4>
<dd>DEMOGL_SetVariable comes in three versions: one integer variables, one for string variables and one for boolean variables.
	<b>DEMOGL_SetVariable</b> sets variables DemoGL works with and control the look, feel and behaviour of the application, during
	startup and / or runtime. Furthermore these variables are needed to tell DemoGL where to find data needed by the application and
	how to retrieve that data.

			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Switches on/off VSYNC in the driver, if the driver supports this. When <i>true</i> DemoGL
				will switch ON VSYNC immediately, which means the OpenGL driver will wait with the backbuffer-
				frontbuffer flip when the vertical retrace takes place, which is dependant on the frequency of
				the user's monitor.

				is DGL_FSRC_LOADFROMDATAFILE, DGL_VF_SRCDIR specifies which dir inside the datafile should be
				used and which datafile is specified by DGL_VF_DATAFILENAME. When <i>iValue</i> is
				DGL_FSRC_LOADFROMDIR, DGL_VFSRCDIR specifies the sourcedirectory where to read from and

				DGL_FSRC_LOADFROMDATAFILE, DGL_VF_SRCDIR specifies the directory inside the datafile to see as
				root directory which contains all directories and files to read the datafiles from. If DGL_VF_FILESRC
				is DGL_FSRC_LOADFROMDIR, DGL_VF_SRCDIR specifies the actual directory on disk where to read the
				datafiles from. DGL_VF_SRCDIR is placed before each filename passed to DemoGL to make the complete

				execution. The effectiveness of this variable depends on DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWFPS. If DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWFPS

				one of the keys that make the system console be visible instead of the effects will not have any effect: the console
				will never appear.

			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_SHOWDEBUGINFO</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies if the debug info overlay is visible (true) or not (false) during normal execution when the
				system console is not visible. Setting this	variable will have effect in the next frame. 
				It's equivalent by pressing F5 during application execution. The effectiveness of this variable depends 
				on DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWDEBUGINFO. If DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWDEBUGINFO is false, DGL_VF_SHOWDEBUGINFO has no effect: 
				the debug info overlay will never show. The debug info overlay is essentially a copy of a part of the system console
				content, so you can see what is logged to the console during normal application execution. Debug info has to be
				on to be able to switch on the input prompt by pressing F6. So locking the debug info overlay using
				DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWDEBUGINFO will also lock the input prompt.
				<p>
				<b>Default:</b> false<br>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWDEBUGINFO</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">

				can be switched on or not. When DGL_VF_NEVERSHOWDEBUGINFO is true, pressing F5 or setting DGL_VF_SHOWDEBUGINFO
				to true won't have any effect: the debug info overlay and with that the possibility to switch on the inputprompt
				will never show up.

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_NEVERRESCALETEXTURES</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies if DemoGL should switch on (false) or off (true) the checkbox in the startup dialog which allows the user
				to select if textures used by the application and managed by DemoGL should be rescaled when the videocard can't handle
				the textures because the size(s) of the textures exceed the maximum limits of the videocard. Voodoo3's have f.e. a
				maximum limit of 256x256 pixels per texture. Using a 512x512 texture in an application will cause an OpenGL error
				on a Voodoo3, which results in that the texture won't show up. When the user is able to select the checkbox on the
				startup dialog, DemoGL will rescale any texture, by preserving proportions, to a size that can be handled by the
				videocard. Of course this can lead to blurry textures, since the textures are scaled down, so the developer can
				decide if the user is able to rescale or not, by setting DGL_VF_NEVERRESCALETEXTURES to true (the user is not able
				to select rescaling) or false (the user is able to select rescaling). Rescaling is done using the glu32 functions.
				<p>
				<b>Default:</b> true<br>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_QUICKBOOT</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies if DemoGL should log to the system console every message produced during startup of the application (false) 
				or that is should log to the system console only error messages (true). During development it's handy to have the 
				complete messagelog in the system console, but this can be a bit slow during application startup. Specifying true for
				DGL_VF_QUICKBOOT will only report the very necessary messages and all errormessages, resulting in a very fast
				startup, which is what you want when you release your application.
				<p>
				<b>Default:</b> true<br>
				<b>Type:</b> bool
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_USERENDERFRAMEEX</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies if DemoGL should use the effect object's method <i>RenderFrame</i> or the new method <i>RenderFrameEx</i> when
				an effect object should be rendered. RenderFrameEx is the same as RenderFrame but it also receives the layer number the
				effectobject is running on. This can be handy when you want to run a <a HREF="ref_classes_CEffect.htm" target="main">CEffect</a>
				derived effect class on more than one layer, and you start the instance of that effect class on more than one layer. You can
				then make the effect behave differently on each layer, by including special rendercode in the RenderFrameEx method of 
				the effect class which uses the layer number. It best works with multiple instances of the same effect class, running
				on their own layers. You should create and register these instances in the WinMain function.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_INITFAILURERESPONSE</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies what DemoGL should do when the Init method of a <a HREF="ref_classes_CEffect.htm" target="main">CEffect</a> derived
				class fails during the startup of the application. When DGL_VF_INITFAILURERESPONSE is DGL_AIFF_IGNORE and the Init method
				reports as returnvalue SYS_NOK, nothing is done and DemoGL continues as nothing happened. When DGL_VF_INITFAILURERESPONSE is
				set to DGL_AIFF_DIE and the Init method of an effect object reports SYS_NOK, DemoGL will abort further execution and 
				<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> will return to the caller. When DGL_VF_INITFAILURERESPONSE
				is DGL_AIFF_REMOVE and the Init method of an effect object reports SYS_NOK, DemoGL will remove the effect object from
				the effect store, like it was never registered. All commands in the script will fail, but execution of the application
				continues.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">DGL_VF_SWAPBUFFERS</td>
			<td VALIGN="TOP" class="TDSmallerFont">
				Specifies if DemoGL should swap the back- and frontbuffer when all layers have been drawn (true) or not (false). Setting this
				parameters has effect in the current rendercycle, thus immediately, so it's important when you set this variable when you
				want to use this feature during runtime. A possible usage can be that you want to render all layers in the backbuffer, create
				a texture of that backbuffer and clear the backbuffer again, then render another scene with the texture just created.

<dd><p>
<dt><b>Remarks.</b>
<dd>It's important you set the values you want to use in your application as early as possible, preferably as
	one of the first statements in the WinMain function, especially parameters needed for loading data from disk, f.e. DemoGL can't
	load the script, needed for execution, when it doesn't know which datafile to use to load the script from. Other variables
	can be set/reset as much as needed during execution.
