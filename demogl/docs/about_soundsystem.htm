<h4>The soundsystem.</h4>
DemoGL contains an advanced soundsystem that is capable of playing MP3's, .WAV files and MOD/MTM/S3M/IT/XM files using 2D, 3D
and EAX logic at the same time. The soundsystem of v1.3 is modeled around BASS v0.9, written by Ian Luck. DemoGL provides
both in its API and in scriptcommands an easy way to play sounds and music. 
<p>
The basis of soundsystem are sound elements and sound channels, in short: elements and channels. Elements are blocks of data
containing MP3, .WAV or MOD (MOD/MTM/S3M/IT/XM) data. These elements are played through channels, thus the channels are in fact
the playing versions of the elements: elements contain the data played and channels play that data through the sound card. Starting
the play of an element (in short: starting an element) will result in the creation of a channel that will take care of the playing
of that element's data. Because these two items are separated, setting channel properties only affects the channel, not the element.
<p>
Elements can be one of three types: MP3 element, SAMPLE element (.wav) or MOD element (MOD/MTM/S3M/IT/XM). Because BASS is used to
perform the playback of the elements, the soundsystem has to work with certain limitations of the BASS library. One of these limitations
is that an element of type DGL_SS_MP3ELEMENT (an MP3 element) or type DGL_SS_MODELEMENT (a MOD element, element contains data stored in
one of the following formats: XM/IT/S3M/MTM or MOD) can be started on as much as one channel, so when an element is already started
and already playing on a channel and its started again, the currently playing channel is stopped and the new started channel is doing
the playback of the element. DGL_SS_SAMPLEELEMENT (a Sample element, element contains data stored in the .wav format) elements can
be started on as much channels as you like, each can have different properties like 3D parameters or EAX parameters, volume, panning,
frequencies etc.
<p>
Elements have two ID's to identify them: an ElementCodeID and an ElementScriptID. The ElementCodeID is used internally in DemoGL to 
identify elements and is used by soundsystem related functions in the DemoGL API. Because ElementCodeID's are generated at runtime, 
they are not usable in the script which is created before application execution. Therefor DemoGL supports also an ElementScriptID. This 
is an ID that is used in the script to identify sound elements when specifying script commands. The DemoGL API supplies support for 
ElementScriptID's to make it possible to convert ElementScriptID's into ElementCodeID's so for example an element can be used from 
code using the faster ElementCodeID when it's created n the script using an ElementScriptID. When an element is loaded from code, DemoGL
wants the developer to specify an ElementScriptID so it can be referenced by a TLE. It's recommended to use ElementCodeID's when
interacting with elements from code and not the ElementScriptID's because internally DemoGL has to convert the ElementScriptID to an
ElementCodeID at runtime. The same thing is done for channels: a channel has two ID's: the ChannelScriptID and the ChannelCodeID. When
an element is started using a TLE, the channel that is created gets the ChannelScriptID specified in the command in the TLE. The channel
is then usable from code using that ChannelScriptID, or better: the ChannelCodeID of that channel, which is retrieved by converting the
ChannelScriptID to a ChannelCodeID. See the soundsystem related API functions in the DemoGL Reference manual 
for more details about CodeID's and ScriptID's plus the <a HREF="ref_scriptsyntax_SOUNDSYSTEM.htm">_SOUNDSYSTEM script syntax</a>.
<p>
Working with sound in your application begins by loading the sounddata into sound elements. This can be done using a TLE in the script
or an API call from code. As soon as the element is created it is ready to be started. However, DemoGL will only start elements from the
start of the application, thus from timespot=0 or higher. When the element is started using a TLE in the script of an API call from code,
DemoGL will use the properties of the element to set several properties of the channel created. This way, a developer can set channel
related properties for all channels the element will be played on. After the channel is created, its properties can be changed using
TLE's from the script or API calls from code. 
<p>
Not all functionality of the soundsystem related API functions is also available for TLE's. This is done because some functionality
is based on runtime information or information that is easily generated at runtime but hard to determine when creating the script. 
Among those functionality are 3D positioning and 3D property settings of channels and elements, the 3D position of the listener
(see for a discussion about the 3D position of the listener
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemSetListener3DPosition.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemSetListener3DPosition</a> in the DemoGL Reference manual)
and MOD element synchronisation functionality.
