<h4>Definitions and defaults.</h4>
Below are specified the definitions and defaults for all kind of small things, which are overlooked easily.
Most of these definitions and details are already explained with the API or command specifications. Others
are mentioned here for the first time. Trivial topics are excluded, only necessary info is included, which
have to be known to make your DemoGL usage a succesful one. The topics are ordered per subject to make
browsing as easy as possible.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Registry related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Hive where startup data is stored</b>
			<dl>
			<dt>
			<dd><dl>
				<dt>RunType is RUNTYPE_NORMAL:
				<dd>HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Application/<i>Application title</i>/AppData
				<dt>RunType is RUNTYPE_SAVER_*:
				<dd>HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Screensaver/<i>Application title</i>/AppData
				</dl>
			</dl>
			<p>
		<li><b>Working directory for screensavers</b>. A key in the startup data hive
			called <i>sWorkingDir</i>, should contain the working directory of the
			screensaver application, when DemoGL runs in a RUNTYPE_SAVER_* RunType, so
			DemoGL can find the needed datafiles. Custom screensaver installers should
			fill this key. When the key is not found or is empty, DemoGL will try to
			determine the working directory using the application execution path and will
			assume the directory wherefrom the application is executed, is the working
			directory.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Soundsystem related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Maximum amount of loadable sound elements</b>. 
			DemoGL supports 4096 loaded sound elements at once. When there are 4096 sound elements
			loaded, any call to <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemLoadElement.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemLoadElement</a> will
			fail. To make room, free some sound elements not used that moment using 
			<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SoundSystemFreeElement.htm">DEMOGL_SoundSystemFreeElement</a>. If you need more than
			4096 sound elements loaded at a given time, you should adjust the constant DGL_SS_AMLOADABLESOUNDELEMENTS
			in the DemoGL sourcecode (dgl_dllsoundsystem.h) and recompile the DemoGL DLL. This is however not recommended because
			it will degrade system performance.
			<p>
		<li><b>Maximum amount of concurrent playing sound channels</b>. 
			DemoGL supports 2048 concurrent playing sound channels at once. When there are 2048 playing sound channels at once,
			starting another sound element will fail. If you need more than	2048 sound channels playing concurrently at a given
			time, you should adjust the constant DGL_SS_AMCHANNELS in the DemoGL sourcecode (dgl_dllsoundsystem.h) and recompile the DemoGL DLL.
			This is however not recommended since it will degrade systemperformance.
			<p>
	</ul </UL>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Startup Dialog related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Custom image on Startup Dialog</b>. DemoGL will look for the resource with
			symbolID 140 in the application instance. This custom image should be 91 pixels
			wide and 433 pixels high. Store the picture as a .bmp in the resource file of the
			application.
			<p>
		<li><b>SStartupDat appliance</b>. DemoGL will first use the data passed in the SStartupDat
			structure and will overrule these settings with the settings stored in the registry, if
			found. The resulting set is then used to fill in the options available on the startup
			dialog.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Application Window related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Application Icon</b>. DemoGL will look for the resource with the symbolID <b>110</b> (defined in resource.h most of
			the time) in the application instance. This custom icon is then used as application icon. If no icon is used, 
			DemoGL will use it's own DemoGL icon as application icon.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Screensaver RunTypes related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Screensaver name in windows</b>. When you want your screensaver application a decent name for
			the screensaver tab's drop down box, add a string table resource to your application and give it
			symbolID 1. The first entry in the string table should be the 'IDS_STR_DESCRIP' with value 1 and the
			caption is the name of the screensaver in the dropdown box in Windows display properties.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Console related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Press F1 for help</b>. Press F1 for a little help-screen which keys will give which results.
			Press 'Page Up' to scroll 1 page up, press 'Page Down' to scroll one page down, the 'up'-arrow
			key will scroll one line up, the 'down'-arrow key will scroll one line down. 
			<p>
		<li><b>Commands on the input-prompt</b>. You can execute script commands from the input prompt, which is
			activatable by pressing F5 (enable debugmode) and then F6 (enable input prompt). The syntax for
			the commands executed on the input prompt is identical to the syntax used in the script, except
			the commands on the input prompt get executed immediately so the commands shouldn't contain a 
			timespot in front of the object name. For example: instead of 1000;_SYSTEM;END; you type: _SYSTEM;END;
			<p>
		<li><b>DemoGL system textures</b>. DemoGL uses a special directory for the textures needed for the console: 
			<b>systex</b>. This directory is expected in the datafile rootdir (that is: 
			inside the datafile) or in the data directory you use. If you remove this 
			directory or simply do not include this directory in your datafile, DemoGL's 
			console will be black and empty. If you include the systex directory in your 
			datafile, also include the files that need to be there: <i>cnslbg.jpg</i>, which 
			is the console background texture with size 256x256 pixels and 2 fonttextures, 
			both .bmp files and of size 256x256 pixels. 
			<p>
		<li><b>Console font</b>. If you want to change the font, check the current fontfiles first. DemoGL 
			doesn't support proportional fonts. Each character is 26x26 
			pixels, placed in 32x32 pixels wide squares. The font is placed on a 512x256 
			texture which is cut in half.
			<p>
		<li><b>Default appearance</b>. Default the console buffer contains 500 lines, the console window
			itself shows 50 lines on screen, including header and inputprompt lines, and has 80 chars per line.
			The debug overlay contains 9 lines by default: 1 for the timer and 8 for the console contents.
			Change this by calling <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance</a>.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Supported platforms related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Hardware</b>. All 3D cards are supported except voodoo1 and voodoo2. 
			<p>
		<li><b>Operating System</b>. DemoGL will run on Windows95/98/ME, Windows NT4, Windows2000 and all 'SE' and 
			'OSR1/2/2.5' variants. No need for extra DLL's than the BASS dll (v0.8a or higher) supplied in the SDK.
			<p>
		<li><b>3D Api</b>. Only OpenGL 1.1 and higher is supported. DemoGL will likely fail to work correctly
			with OpenGL v1.0. Current Windows' OpenGL version is v1.1.
			<p>
		<li><b>Compiler</b>. DemoGL is a C/C++ library and is only compiled for VC++ 5 and 6. Users of other compilers
			should port the DemoGL sourcecode to their compiler platform. Users of VC++ v5.0 should use the
			special import library DemoGL_DLLVC50.lib, available in the SDK.
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Distributing your application related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>What to distribute</b>. Distribute with your application, datafile(s) and own DLL's, the DemoGL
			DLL (DemoGL_DLL.dll) and the BASS DLL (bass.dll, v0.8a or higher). 
			<p>
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>OpenGL related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Setup</b>. DemoGL sets the initial frustum to glFrustum(-1.0, 1.0, -0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 20.0); 
			<p>
		<li><b>OpenGL buffer clearing</b>. DemoGL doesn't clear any buffers, you should do this yourself, for 
			example in an effect at layer 0.
	</ul>
	<p>
<dt><hr size="1" width="80%" align="left">
	<b>Data file related</b>
<dd><p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Format</b>. DemoGL's datafile format is ZIP. So you can use a normal ZIP file as the datafile to
			load the actual files from.
			<p>
		<li><b>Directory specification</b>. DemoGL forces you to use '\' as directory delimiter, even if
			the zip tools sometimes make you use '/'. So refering to a texture foo.jpg in the directory demotex
			results in &quot;demotex\\foo.jpg&quot;, in every case. This way you can use datafiles and data directories
			in a flexible way without recoding the pathnames in your code when you switch between datafile and
			data directory loading.
	</ul>
