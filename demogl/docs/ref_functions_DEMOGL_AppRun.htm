<dt><h4>DEMOGL_AppRun</h4>
<dd>DEMOGL_AppRun starts the DemoGL powered part of your application. This part can be a normal execution of the 
	Timeline events scripted in the application script as a normal win32 program, as a screensaver or as a screensaver
	preview. It can also start the configuration part of your application when that application is a screensaver.

	</pre>
<dt><b>Parameters.</b>
<dd><dl>
	<dt><i>hInstance</i>
	<dd>The instance of the application. This value is passed to WinMain() by windows. This value is needed
		to let DemoGL access resources stored in your application, for example an icon or a bitmap that should
		show up on the startup dialog. See <A HREF="ref_definitionsanddefaults.htm">Definitions and Defaults</A>
		for more details.
	<dt><i>psdStartupDat</i>
	<dd>Pointer to a <a HREF="ref_structures_SStartupDat.htm">SStartupDat</a> structure, which contains all the
		data DemoGL needs to startup and run your application succesfully. Can be NULL, which results in the
		usage of the values stored in the registry, if present, or if not present the default build in values. 
		When you pass a <a HREF="ref_structures_SStartupDat.htm">SStartupDat</a>
		structure to <b>DEMOGL_AppRun</b>, you should set every value of the structure.
	<dt><i>pszWindowTitle</i>
	<dd>Pointer to a zero-terminated string which will result in the title of the application's window, when 
		applicable. This title is displayed in the dragbar/titlebar of the window, when the application runs in
		windowed mode. 
	<dt><i>bUseCrypting</i>
	<dd>Specifies whether to enable or disable decryption. If this parameter is <i>true</i>, decryption is enabled
		and DemoGL will decrypt all the data loaded before it's passed back to the caller. As decryption keys
		are used the values specified in <i>byKey1</i> and <i>byKey2</i>. If this parameter is <i>false</i>, these
		variables are ignored.
	<dt><i>byKey1</i>
	<dd>Specifies the first decryption key for the decryption process. Only valid when <i>bUseCrypting</i> is <i>true</i>.
		You crypt your data with Cryde.
	<dt><i>byKey2</i>
	<dd>Specifies the second decryption key for the decryption process. Only valid when <i>bUseCrypting</i> is <i>true</i>.
		You crypt your data with Cryde.
	<dt><i>iRunType</i>
	<dd>Specifies how your application should run. <i>iRunType</i> can be one of the following values:

				The default. Your application will run like a normal win32 application. DemoGL will open a startup

				terminating the application or the user terminates the application. DemoGL will recover from errors

<p>
<dt><b>Return values.</b>
<dd>If the function succeeds, it returns <i>SYS_OK</i>.<br>
	If the function fails, it returns <i>SYS_NOK</i>.
	<p>
<dt><b>Remarks.</b>
<dd>After you've registered your effectobjects with <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_EffectRegister.htm">DEMOGL_EffectRegister</a>, you
	can start the application by calling <b>DEMOGL_AppRun</b>, specifying startup properties and the RunType DemoGL should use. For
	normal win32 application runtimes, like RUNTYPE_NORMAL and RUNTYPE_NODIALOG, you know what runtype to run your application in.
	This is not the case when it comes to a screensaver application, powered by DemoGL. Windows will specify on the command line
	how the screensaver should behave: as a preview window, as a normal screensaver, as a configuration window or as a password
	unlock instance (not implemented in DemoGL, see RUNTYPE_SAVER_PASSWORD). To determine which RunType you should specify
	when your screensaver application is ran, call <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ParseScreenSaverCL.htm">DEMOGL_ParseScreenSaverCL</a>
	and pass the commandline received by WinMain() to the function.	<b>DEMOGL_ParseScreenSaverCL</b> will then fill a
	<a HREF="ref_structures_SScreenSaverCLParams.htm">SScreenSaverCLParams</a> structure for you which contains the type of
	screensaver runtype you should use. Your application can now determine if it first should open it's own configuration 
	dialog, or for example if it should start the screensaver normally. You can first program your screensaver as a normal
	application using RUNTYPE_NORMAL or RUNTYPE_NODIALOG, and when the application runs as planned you can include the 
	commandline parsing logic to actually run the application as a screensaver. After you've done that you should rename
	the executable to a name with the extension .scr and the screensaver is finished.
	See the example below.
	<p>
	The values specified in <i>psdStartupDat</i>&nbsp; are always overruled by the values eventually stored in the registry, except when 
	you specify RUNTYPE_NODIALOG as RunType. <i>psdStartupDat</i>&nbsp; values are used as hints to set options in the startup dialog
	or the config dialog and as execution specific values when a startup dialog or config dialog is not applicable. The values set in the
	startup dialog and the config dialog are stored in different places in the registry. For RUNTYPE_NORMAL applications, the values
	are stored in the registry key HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Application/<i>Application title</i>/AppData. For RUNTYPE_SAVER_* applications,
	the values are stored in the registry key HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Screensaver/<i>Application title</i>/AppData, by using the RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG
	RunType. It's recommended you should store custom application parameters inside these registry keys, depending on the RunType.
	<p>
	When you call <b>DEMOGL_AppRun</b> DemoGL will take over control of your application. The only code in your application that is called
	is the code inside the registered effectobjects. You should call <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppEnd.htm">DEMOGL_AppEnd</a> after
	<b>DEMOGL_AppRun</b> returns, no matter what returnvalue it will return.
	<p>
<dt><b>Example.</b>
<dd>Below you'll find an example which shows how to determine the RunType of the current instance of the application and how to
	use it succesfully. It also shows where you should place your own config dialog startcode when you've written a screensaver using
	DemoGL which relies on settable parameters. You can add a button to that config dialog that calls <b>DEMOGL_AppRun</b> with the
	RunType RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG to let the user set runtime specific settings like screendepth, resolution, sound etc.
	<p>
	<pre>
// Declare a pointer to the screensaver command line parameter structure
SScreenSaverCLParams	*pSSCLParams;
	
// Parse commandline for screensaver exectype
pSSCLParams=DEMOGL_ParseScreenSaverCL(lpCmdLine);

iRunType=RUNTYPE_NORMAL;

// start as a screensaver
switch(pSSCLParams-&gt;iSaverExecType)
{
	case DGL_SSAVERET_CONFIG:
	{
		/////////////////////////
		// Insert your own configwindow initialisation and start up code HERE
		// If you do you shouldn't enter DEMOGL_AppRun() below but include it
		// in your dialog with a button.
		/////////////////////////
		iRunType=RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG;
	}; break;
	case DGL_SSAVERET_NORMAL:
	{
		iRunType=RUNTYPE_SAVER_NORMAL;
	}; break;
	case DGL_SSAVERET_PREVIEW:
	{
		iRunType=RUNTYPE_SAVER_PREVIEW;
	}; break;
	default:
	{
		// should not run, unknown or unsupported screensaver type.
		iRunType=RUNTYPE_UNKNOWN;	// will return immediately
	}; break;
}
// Start the application. We won't return until the demo ends (by userinteraction or by script) or 
// when a fatal error occurs.
DEMOGL_AppRun(hInstance, &amp;sdStartupDatValues, &quot;My title&quot;, false,0,0,iRunType);

// End it. Call this routine to signal DemoGL it's all over and it should release
// claimed resources.
DEMOGL_AppEnd();
