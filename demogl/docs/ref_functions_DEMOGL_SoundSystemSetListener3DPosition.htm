<dt><h4>DEMOGL_SoundSystemSetListener3DPosition</h4>
<dd>DEMOGL_SoundSystemSetListener3DPosition sets the position of the global listener, i.e. the user watching the application, in 3D space, 
	inclusive its orientation. This way, the sound logic can calculate how the active sound channels will be heared by the 'user' at the 
	global listeners position. There is one global listener position defined for all active channels. You can't have multiple listeners
	for different 3D setups in different effects running at the same time.</a>

	<p>
<dt><b>Remarks.</b>
<dd>The position of the global listener is important for the sound logic
	to calculate the actually sound behaviour of all the active channels when those sounds arrive at the spot where the global listener
	is, if these channels are playing sound from elements which are loaded with 3D enabled. Channels playing sound data that
	is owned by elements which are loaded with 3D disabled, are not affected by the position of the global listener. When you want to
	make a moving global listener, and let the sound logic be able to update the current position to make the sounds appear correctly
	you should call <b>DEMOGL_SoundSystemSetListener3DPosition</b> each frame, but only once per frame, not from each running effect, because
	there is just one global listener.
	<p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> There is just <i>one</i> &nbsp;listener position in the sound system, because that's the way the underlying sound library
	works. This way, you have to keep in mind that two or more effects visible at the same time with total different scenes have to use the
	same global listener position for their 3D enabled sound channels. It will be odd at first, but it's the same way OpenGL works: there
	is no camera, the frustum is always at (0,0,0) looking at the negative Z, the world is moved/rotated so it looks as if the 'camera' is
	rotated/moved. Updating the global listener position in more than one effect in one frame is useless: only the last one will have any
	effect.
