<h4>Reacting on userinput.</h4>
Some audiovisual applications are non-interactive, they visualize effects and play audio at the same time
to entertain the people watching. However, it might be possible to have some interaction from the user
of the application, for example a game using DemoGL as the execution host, or a demonstration program that
needs mouse support to click objects shown in the effects.
<p>
Besides the possibility to use DirectInput to retrieve keyboard, mouse and joystick feedback from the user,
it's possible to use basic Windows messages to react on keyboard and mouse activity (for joysticks you need
DirectInput). DirectInput can be placed in one effectobject that polls every cycle in its RenderFrame method
the activity queue.
<p>
To retrieve normal Windows messages received on keyboard and/or mouse activity, first enable the
MessageHandler of the effectobjects that have to receive the input by using 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_MessageHandlerEnable.htm">DEMOGL_MessageHandlerEnable</a>. Then to 
react on keyboard and mouse activity, you could implement something like the code snippet below, in the
MessageHandler method of the effectobject which messagehandler is enabled.
<pre>
// Purpose: the messagehandler of this effect. if we enable it we'll receive 
// every message posted to the window of the current app. This is handy if we want to 
// receive keyboard or mouse messages.
void
C3DView::MessageHandler(HWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM  wParam, LPARAM  lParam)
{
	int		iX, iY;

	switch(uMsg)
	{
		case WM_MOUSEMOVE:
		{
			if(m_bLMBDown)
			{
				// user is dragging with the mouse. get x and y delta's and
				// reflect the delta's on the rotation angles of a rotating
				// object.
				
				// get X and Y
				iX=GET_X_LPARAM(lParam);
				iY=GET_Y_LPARAM(lParam);
				m_fAlpha= m_fAlpha + (float)(iY - m_iYPrev);
				m_fBeta= m_fBeta + (float)(iX - m_iXPrev);
				m_iXPrev=iX;
				m_iYPrev=iY;
			}
		};break;
		case WM_LBUTTONDOWN:
		{
			m_bLMBDown=true;
			iX=GET_X_LPARAM(lParam);
			iY=GET_Y_LPARAM(lParam);
		}; break;
		case WM_LBUTTONUP:
		{
			m_bLMBDown=false;
		};break;
		case WM_RBUTTONDOWN:
		{
			// as an example, exit the application.
			DEMOGL_ExecuteCommand(&quot;_SYSTEM;END;&quot;);
		};break;
		case WM_CHAR:
		{
			// received a character done by a keypress (in: (char)wParam)
		}; break;
		case WM_KEYDOWN:
		{
			// received a keycode done by a keypress (in: wParam)
		}; break;
	}
}
</pre>
The codesnippet above will receive mouse activity related messages and will react on them, for example, the 
dragging of the user will result in the rotation of an object visualized by the C3DView class this method is
a member of. For fast paced games it's perhaps wise to use DirectInput, but for normal mouse and keyboard
usage this scheme with Windows Messages is good enough.
<p>
DemoGL will pass every message received to the effectobjects which messagehandlers are enabled. The developer
doesn't have to pass back the messages to windows. This is done by DemoGL.
