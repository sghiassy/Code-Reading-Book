<dt><h4>DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic</h4>
<dd>DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic creates a new cubemap texture in the texture store of DemoGL. The texture contains
however no data, that is: the textures are black with an alpha of 0.0f. The advantage of this routine is that when you 
want to use dynamic cubemaps, you can only update <i>existing</i> cubesides, i.e. an existing, uploaded cubemap. To get
an uploaded cubemap, you can load a dummy cubemap with 
<A HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapLoad.htm">DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapLoad</A>, upload it and
then update the sides of that cubemap texture using 
<A HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapUpdateWithFBRegion.htm">DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapUpdateWithFBRegion</A>. 
However, avoiding the overhead of including a dummy cubemap, just call <B>DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic</b> and
update the sides of that texture.

<b>GLuint</b>
DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic(
	<b>const int</b> <i>iWidth</i>,
	<b>const int</b> <i>iHeight</i>,
	<B>const char</b> *<i>pszIdentName</i>,
	<b>const int</b> <i>iBorder</i>,
	<b>const GLint</b> <i>iMinFilter</i>,
	<b>const GLint</b> <i>iMagFilter</i>,
	<b>const GLint</b> <i>iTexUploadHint</i>
);
	</pre>
<dt><b>Parameters.</b>
<dd><dl>
	<dt><i>iWidth</i>
	<dd>Width of the cubemap sides, in pixels. Has to be a power of 2 and great than 0.
	<dt><i>iHeight</i>
	<dd>Height of the cubemap sides, in pixels. Has to be a power of 2 and great than 0.
	<dt><i>pszIdentName</i>
	<dd>Pointer to a zero-terminated string which represents the name of the texture so other effects which will load the same
		texture by specifying the same name will receive a reference to this texture instead. Normally textures are globally referenced
		by the filename of the file with the texturedata, for cubemap textures created with 
		<b>DEMOGL_TextureCubeCreateDynamic</b> there is no file, so you can specify any	string as IdentName.
	<dt><i>iBorder</i>
	<dd>Specifies the width of the textureborder in OpenGL for this texture, normally 0 or 1.
	<dt><i>iMinFilter</i>
	<dd>Sets the texture minifying function. Can be one of the following values:

		<th BGCOLOR="#e8e8e8" align="left" width="52%">Meaning</th></tr>
		<tr vAlign="top">
			<td width="48%">GL_NEAREST </td>
			<td width="52%">Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in 
				Manhattan distance) to the center of the pixel being textured. 
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr vAlign="top">
			<td width="48%">GL_LINEAR</td>
			<td width="52%">
				Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that 
				are closest to the center of the pixel being textured. GL_NEAREST is generally faster than 
				GL_LINEAR, but it can produce textured images with sharper edges because the 
				transition between texture elements is not as smooth. 
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr vAlign="top">
			<td width="48%">GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST</td>
			<td width="52%">Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the 
				pixel being textured and uses the GL_NEAREST criterion (the texture element 
				nearest to the center of the pixel) to produce a texture value. 
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr vAlign="top">
			<td width="48%">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST</td>
			<td width="52%">Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the

			<td width="48%">GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</td>
			<td width="52%">Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the

		<p>
	<dt><i>iMagFilter</i>
	<dd>Sets the texture magnification function. The texture magnification function is used when the pixel being textured maps to 
		an area less than or equal to one texture element. It sets the texture 	magnification function to either GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR.
	<dt><i>iTexUploadHint</i>
	<dd>Specifies the upload hint which should be used when DemoGL uploads the texture data to OpenGL.
		This hint is ment for the situation when the user has selected 16bit textures ONLY. In this
		situation normally DemoGL selects GL_RGBA4 as texturehint for the upload process to OpenGL, so you'll get better
		alphachannel support. If this isn't necessary in a situation, because the texture doesn't use
		the alphavalues, you can specify an overruling hint for DemoGL to pass on to OpenGL in 16bit. A
		good hint for nonalpha textures is GL_RGB5_A1. In situations where the user has selected 32bit textures
		(recommended, since the driver will transform these to 16bit if necessary and will dither, which
		gives better results) this hint is ignored and GL_RGBA8 is used. If DemoGL should use the default
		hint for this texture whenever it has to, set iTexUploadHint to DGL_TEXHINT_USEDEFAULT.

<p>
<dt><b>Return values.</b>
<dd>If the function succeeds, it returns the TextureID, or <i>texture name</i>, usable with functions in OpenGL like 
	glBindTexture.<br>
	If the function failes, 0 is returned.
	<p>
<dt><b>Remarks.</b>
<dd>If the videocard doesn't support cubemaps, <b>DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic</b> will fail. 
	When you create or load a cubemap texture with the same value for <i>pszIdentName</i>, DemoGL will increase the 
	reference counter to the loaded texture instead of loading / creating the texturedata again. 
	The texture created with <b>DEMOGL_TextureCubeMapCreateDynamic</b> can be used with the normal 
	upload/unupload and delete functions for textures:
	<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureDelete.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_TextureDelete</a>,
	<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureUnUpload.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_TextureUnUpload</a> and
	<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_TextureUpload.htm" target="main">DEMOGL_TextureUpload</a>.
	However, dynamic updated cubesides can't be re-uploaded, once the texture is un-uploaded. To keep dynamic created
	cubemaps available, don't un-upload the cubemap texture.
	<p>
	Cubemapping is implemented in hardware using the DirectX concepts. This means that negative Z en positive Z are switched.
	See DemoGL Example 6 for example code on how to use DemoGL to render objects using cubemaps. It's recommended to 
	read nVidia's documentation about cubemaps and OpenGL also on their developer site, especially 
	<b>CubeEnvMapping2.pdf</b>.
	<p>
	DemoGL_glext.h contains all necessary constant definitions for cubemapping. When you use cubemaps in your code, be sure
	to include DemoGL_glext.h.
