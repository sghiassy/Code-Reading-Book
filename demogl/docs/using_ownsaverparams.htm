<h4>Adding a custom screensaver parameter dialog.</h4>
When implementing a screensaver application the way as described in <a HREF="using_simplescreensaver.htm">Creating a simple screensaver</a>, 
every time the user selects 'settings' or 'configure' to configure the screensaver, the DemoGL startup dialog appears, allowing only
runtime display and soundsystem parameters to be changed. This is due to the fact that when the screensaver is started in the
configure mode by Windows (the iSaverExecType member of the <a HREF="ref_structures_SScreenSaverCLParams.htm">SSCreenSaverCLParams</a> is
DGL_SSAVERET_CONFIG) and you just pass RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG as runtype to DemoGL without doing anything, DemoGL will pop up the startup
dialog, as shown in the <a HREF="using_simplescreensaver.htm">Creating a simple screensaver</a> example.
<p>
Most screensavers however are customizable, like how many objects are on screen or which colorschemes etc etc, or better: <i>should be</i>
customizable. DemoGL allows you to create as customizable screensavers as you can imagine, by just using the standard DemoGL library.
Examine the codesnippet below, taken from the <a HREF="using_simplescreensaver.htm">Creating a simple screensaver</a> example:
<pre>
	// ... other code
	
	// Parse commandline for screensaver exectype.
	// lpCmdLine is a parameter of WinMain()
	pSSCLParams=DEMOGL_ParseScreenSaverCL(lpCmdLine);

	// Determine the runtype, using the parsed commandline
	// parameters.	
	switch(pSSCLParams-&gt;iSaverExecType)
	{
		case DGL_SSAVERET_CONFIG:
		{
			/////////////////////////
			// Insert your own configwindow initialisation and 
			// start up code HERE. 
			/////////////////////////
			iRunType=RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG;
		}; break;
		
		// ... other code
	}

	// we've now gathered enough information to run this application
	// as a screensaver. Start the application as we did in the 
	// application, now passing the iRunType variable
	DEMOGL_AppRun(hInstance, &amp;sdStartupDatValues, &quot;DemoGL Example&quot;,
		false,0,0,iRunType);

	// ... other code
}
</pre>
The snippet marks the place where a custom dialog creation call can be placed, namely just below the 'case DGL_SSAVERET_CONFIG'
statement. The place is logical, because a screensaver application can be run in different modes: 'configuration', which
means the user clicked on 'settings' or 'configure', and no screensaver code should be executed, 'preview', which is
the tiny window on the screensaver tab in Display properties or 'normal', which is the normal screensaver execution
mode: run until the mouse moves or a key is pressed.
<p>
The custom dialog should pop up when the user clicks 'settings' or 'configure', thus when the screensaver (i.e. the
screensaver application using DemoGL) is executed in 'configuration' mode. That dialog then, can have a button which
will call <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_AppRun.htm">DEMOGL_AppRun</a> passing RUNTYPE_SAVER_CONFIG as the runtype
to let the user configure the runtime display and soundsystem parameters. When the user clicks 'Save' in the 
DemoGL startup dialog, DEMOGL_AppRun() will return to the callerfunction, for example the custom dialog message handler.
<p>
Because screensavers are started by the operating system, the settings configured by the user should be stored where
the screensaver application can retrieve them from when it is executed in 'normal' mode. The best place for this
is the windows registry, but any other solution would do, as long as the screensaver application is able to read the 
settings, like how many objects an effectobject should display. The settings configurable by the startup dialog of DemoGL
are already saved in the registry automatically so a developer should just focus on where and how to store the screensaver
specific settings. A good place in the registry is the hive (registry key) where DemoGL saves screensaver specific 
data: HKCU/Software/DemoGL/Screensaver/<i>Application title</i>/AppData. Application title is the title specified
in the m_sDemoName member of the <a HREF="ref_structures_SStartupDat.htm">SStartupDat</a> structure, which is passed
to DEMOGL_AppRun.
