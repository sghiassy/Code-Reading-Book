<h4>The system kernel.</h4>
For developers using the DemoGL system, it's important to know how DemoGL schedules effects, TLE's, 
Windows messages, music files etc. DemoGL is in fact a simple Operating System. It has a bootphase, where
all the initialisation is done, a run phase, where the execution of tasks is done, and a shutdown phase,
where the clean-up of all resources claimed is done. DemoGL uses a simple 'kernel' with a message handler,
an effect executor, a TLE executor and a controlling routine which is the heart of the little kernel. 
<p>
This kernel is in effect when the system is booted up and execution of the application is started. It runs
in one Windows thread, the main application thread. One 'cycle' of the kernel excists of the following steps:
<ul>
	<li>Grab and handle all queued Windows messages
	<li>Get new time from the high resolution timer
	<li>Execute all TLE's that have to be executed on the current new time
	<li>Execute all effects on all visible layers: call the RenderFrame() or RenderFrameEx() methods of
		all effectobjects currently placed on visible layers (see
</ul>
The length of the cycle depends on the execution time of these 4 steps. Windows message handlers are most of
the time really quick and, depending on the length of the previous cycle, the amount of Windows messages
stored in the queue is pretty small. The time calculation routine is always taking the same amount of
time and this is too small to mention. The biggest parts of the time a cycle takes to complete are the
time the TLE's get executed and the time all effects currently running on visible layers take to complete.
This can be important to know, because if a developer schedules a CPU intensive multi-layer part together with
a serie of TLE's that can be CPU intensive (for example a serie of PREPARE TLE's that load and upload texturedata
or calculate geometry), the TLE execution will enlarge the cycle time and thus the framerate of the application.
In fact, if the developer schedules some TLE's that will take, say, 400ms on an average system, the cycle time
when these TLE's get executed will be at least 400ms long, which can make an application to stutter for a moment.
<p>
Plan the TLE execution wisely, thus if the TLE's don't have to be executed on the same timespot, place them on
different timespots. A frame most of the time costs less than 50ms (20 fps), so you can easily place TLE's on
50ms boundaries from eachother.
<p>
The TLE execution isn't placed in a separate thread, while the music/sound engine is running in a separate thread,
because some TLE's will force DemoGL to call effectobject methods. Because OpenGL requires a rendercontext per thread,
executing OpenGL related code in a different thread than where the mainwindow is running in, will not have effect
in OpenGL related code that is running in the mainwindow thread (the main thread): uploading a texture in a different
thread will fail, because the different thread doesn't have a rendercontext. It's possible to create a second
rendercontext just for TLE's and let the display driver merge the two, but some videocard ICD's will not give the
desired results, the reason why DemoGL will do the TLE execution in the same thread as the mainwindow and the effectobjects
are running in.
