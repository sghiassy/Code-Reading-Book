<h4>The console.</h4>
DemoGL contains a console that is toggled visible or hidden when the TAB key or the '~' key is pressed. 
The console is included for developers using DemoGL in their applications. DemoGL logs all kinds of
information on the console, developers can also log information on it and it has an input prompt that
allows the developer to execute TLE's immediately from that command prompt. 
<p>
During the bootphase, DemoGL displays the console and logs all kinds of information, which can be made
invisible by placing a splashscreen on the console during the bootphase (see 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_LoadingSplashEnable.htm">DEMOGL_LoadingSplashEnable</a> for details). Also 
during bootphase, a progress bar can be made visible, displaying the status of the bootphase 
(see <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_LoadingPBEnable.htm">DEMOGL_LoadingPBEnable</a> and
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_LoadingPBSetAppearance.htm">DEMOGL_LoadingPBSetAppearance</a> for details).
<p>
When the bootphase is finished and application execution starts, DemoGL will hide the console, remove the
splash screen and progress bar and will start the application. If no effectobject is started this will result
in a black screen. The developer can bring up the console (make it visible) by pressing the TAB or '~' key.

The console itself contains a buffer that holds lines of text. This buffer can be much larger than the size
of the console. When the buffer is larger than the amount of lines the console can display, you can scroll
through the buffer by using the UP and DOWN arrowkeys and the PgUp and PgDown keys. The developer can specify the
size of the console buffer, the length of the lines on screen and the amount of lines on screen, using the function
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleSetAppearance</a>. The background of the console
is a texture stored in the directory <b>systex</b> and is called <b>cnslbg.jpg</b>. The font is stored on two textures
in the same directory, with filenames: <b>fnt_cnl.bmp</b> and <b>fnt_cnr.bmp</b>. The placement of the systex directory
is depending on whether the developer decides to load from a datafile (a zipped archive) or a directory. See for
more details <a href="about_datafile.htm">I/O Support</a> in this About DemoGL manual.
<p>
The console can visualize system information when certain keys are pressed. Below is the list of keys currently supported
in DemoGL. All keys work when the console is hidden or visible so you don't have to activate the console first. 
<ul>
	<li><b>F1</b>. Displays help about the supported keys on the console.
	<li><b>F2</b>. Toggles FPS counter on or off. This is an overlay at the bottom of the screen on top of all layers.
	<li><b>F3</b>. Displays all layers currently created in DemoGL, the effectobjects on those layers and if the layers are
	    visible or not. This list is displayed on the console.
	<li><b>F4</b>. Displays all registered effectobjects on the console.
	<li><b>F5</b>. Toggles the debug overlay on or off. The debugoverlay is displayed on top of the layers visible when the
	    console is hidden and it contains the last X lines of the consolebuffer, the current position on the timeline and
	    when activated, a commandprompt. The amount of X is 8 by default but changable with 
	    <a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_LoadingPBSetAppearance.htm">DEMOGL_LoadingPBSetAppearance</a>. 
	<li><b>F6</b>. Toggles the input prompt on or off. This option is only available when the debug overlay is activated.
		The input prompt is visible in the console and in the overlay and share the same contents so typing in something
		on the input prompt in the debug overlay has the same effect as typing on the input prompt on the console.
	<li><b>F7</b>. Displays the complete set of defined TLE's, the current timespot on the timeline, if TLE's are executed
		or not, the commands plus objectnames of each TLE and all parameters specified with these TLE's. This list is displayed
		on the console. If you've specified a lot of TLE's in your script, be sure the console buffer can handle a lot of lines.
</ul>
<p>
When the console is made visible, all effectobject execution stops, since no layers are rendered. All TLE execution continues.
When a TLE is typed in on the input prompt, you have to omit the timespot parameter of the TLE so the syntax of a TLE typed
in on the input prompt is:
<pre>
	objectname;command;[parameter1;...parameter64;]
</pre>
See for more information about TLE's: <a HREF="about_script.htm">The script</a> in this About DemoGL manual. 
<p>
The information DemoGL logs on the console is prefixed with a 3 character short marker. The marker is the phase DemoGL is in
when the information was logged. For developers using DemoGL this 3 character information is not important, but if you're modifying
DemoGL it can be useful. See for more information about these prefixes, DemoGL system states and other related information the
DemoGL sourcecode documentation that is distributed with the DemoGL v1.3 sourcecode.
<p> 
A developer can log custom information on the console by using the functions 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLine.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLine</a> and 
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV.htm">DEMOGL_ConsoleLogLineV</a>. See the DemoGL Reference manual for more details about
these functions. 
<p>
Because the console is ment for developers, it should be possible to lock the keys that will bring up the console and bring up certain
other overlays like the debugoverlay, input prompt and FPS counter. A developer can lock out these features by using the function
<a HREF="ref_functions_DEMOGL_SetVariable.htm">DEMOGL_SetVariable</a> to set a lock variable in DemoGL. See the DemoGL Reference
manual for more details about setting variables using DEMOGL_SetVariable.
