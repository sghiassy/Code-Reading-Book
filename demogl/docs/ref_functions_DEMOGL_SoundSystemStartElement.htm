				Sound element stored in the standard windows PCM format, or compressed with a custom CODEC.

	<dt><i>lStartPos</i>
	<dd>Specifies the position where to start the play from. For channels playing DGL_SS_SAMPLEELEMENT sound elements, 
		<i>lStartPos</i> is a position in bytes. For channels playing DGL_SS_MP3ELEMENT sound elements, <i>lStartPos</i> is
		a position in milliseconds from the start. For channels playing DGL_SS_MODELEMENT sound elements, <i>lStartPos</i>
		is a value calculated using the macro MAKELONG: MAKELONG(order,row). This will result in a longword with LOWORD=order in
		the music module and HIWORD=row in that pattern. 
	<dt><i>bLoop</i>
	<dd>Specifies if the sound data owned by the element should be restarted when the play of the data is finished (true) or not (false).
	<dt><i>iVolume</i>
	<dd>Specifies the volume of the sound the resulting channel produces. Values have to fall in the range [0, 100], with
		0 is total silence and 100 is maximum volume. When -1 is specified the current volume value is left untouched.
		Will not have any effect when the sound element	is loaded with 3D disabled.
	<dt><i>iPan</i>
	<dd>Specifies the panning of the resulting channel in 2D. Values have to fall in the range [-100, 100], with -100 will place
		the channel totally on the left speaker and 100 will place the channel totally on the right speaker. When -101 is
		specified the current panning value for this channel is left untouched. Will not have any effect when the sound element
		is loaded with 3D disabled.
	<dt><i>iFrequency</i>
	<dd>The frequency of the output of the resulting channel. Values have to fall in the range [100, 100000] with 100 the minimum
		value and 100000 the maximum value. When 0 is specified the original frequency of the resulting channel when it was created
		is restored. When -1 is specified, the current value for the frequency is left untouched. Will not have any effect when 
		the sound element is loaded with 3D disabled.
		This value is not recommended for DGL_SS_MP3ELEMENT and DGL_SS_MODELEMENT sound element based channels.

	<p>
<dt><b>Remarks.</b>
<dd>The play of sound elements will be done by sound channels, thus elements play their data through sound channels. When a sound
	element is started, it's started on a channel, the element itself is just a container for the sound data. You can refer to the
	playing sound channel by using the iChannelCodeID you receive when the call to <b>DEMOGL_SoundSystemStartElement</b> succeeds.
	Elements of type DGL_SS_MP3ELEMENT and DGL_SS_MODELEMENT can be started only once, or better: just one channel can actually play the
	sound data owned by the element. When you start an element of those types when the element is already playing on another channel, that
	channel will be stopped and the new channel will continue the play. This is due to a limit in the underlying sound library, however
	should not be limiting in most circumstances. You can start elements of type DGL_SS_SAMPLEELEMENT on as much channels as you want, all
	will be playing along.
	<p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> There is just <i>one</i> &nbsp;listener position in the sound system, because that's the way the underlying sound library
	works. This way, you have to keep in mind that two or more effects visible at the same time with total different scenes have to use the
	same global listener position for their 3D enabled sound channels. It will be odd at first, but it's the same way OpenGL works: there
	is no camera, the frustum is always at (0,0,0) looking at the negative Z, the world is moved/rotated so it looks as if the 'camera' is
	rotated/moved. Updating the global listener position in more than one effect in one frame is useless: only the last one will have any
	effect.
