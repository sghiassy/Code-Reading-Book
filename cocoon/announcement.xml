   <p>
    Apache Cocoon is an XML framework that raises the usage of
    XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new level.
    Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX
    processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the
    separation of concerns between content, logic and style.
    A centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching
    top this all off and help you to create, deploy and maintain
    rock-solid XML server applications.
   </p>

   <p>
    This release of Cocoon is a complete rewrite of the Cocoon XML
    publishing framework and removes all of those design constraints
    that emerged from the Cocoon 1 experience.

   <p>
    Today, most web engineers consider XML as the key for an improved
    web model and web site managers see XML as a way to reduce costs
    and ease production. In an era where services rather than software
    will be key for economic success, a better and less expensive model
    for web publishing will be a winner, especially one based on open
    standards.
