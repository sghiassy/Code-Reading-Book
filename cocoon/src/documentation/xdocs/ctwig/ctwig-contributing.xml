			<p>I am more than happy to recieve amendments, improvements and so on to these pages.  I want the information to be as up to date and as accurate as possible so please do not hesitate to let me know if you find anything wrong.  I would also be really pleased to receive submissions of more tutorial documentation for C2.  I hope that sections will develop for areas such as the sitemap, configuration tutorials, development techniques and so on which will require reasonable effort to develop however I think it would also be good to take up the suggestion of a FAQ based on some of the common questions that come up on the list.  I will start this off soon and try and add to it as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>I have written these pages in the xdocs format, thus it would be really useful if any contributions are in that format (see <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/contrib.html">Contributing</link> for explanation of the diff format and CVS).  If you want to see examples of the markup required please check the files in the C2 xdocs folder that comes as part of the distribution.  The DTD is in xdocs/dtd/document-v10.dtd.  I am more than happy to take contributions in email, MS Word, PDF, TXT etc however any conversion may delay the publishing process.</p>
			<p>Please email <link href="mailto:ctwig@pigbite.com">ctwig@pigbite.com</link> with your comments, ideas and submissions.</p>
			<p>Many thanks - Jez</p>
