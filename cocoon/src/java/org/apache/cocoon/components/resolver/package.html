  <h1>Catalog Entity Resolver</h1>
  <p>
    A component that uses catalogs for resolving external entities.
    It sets the entity resolver onto the hook provided by the SAX parser,
    and then handles the resolveEntity() requests.

    This implementation uses the XML Entity and URI Resolvers
    published by Norman Walsh.
