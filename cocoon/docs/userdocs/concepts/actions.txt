WARNING: This material is subject to change at anytime and may
never find a way into the main distribution. It could
be removed if it has proven not to be useful for Cocoon 2.

This is a proposal for a Action sitemap component. For more
information look at the javadoc comments in the file Action.java
in this directory. For a possible implementation look at the file
HelloAction.java.

Create a file named "actions.inc" in the root of the Cocoon 2
repository to include this functionality and execute the command
"build package webapp".

The created cocoon.war and cocoon.jar file in build/cocoon
directory contains the modified version which include the
Action sitemap component and the sample HelloAction which
is called when requesting the URL http://localhost:8080/cocoon/welcome

To give you an overview of the discussion about sitemap Actions here is
an excerpt from the cocoon-dev mailing list:

The example above is probably misleading because we don't have a Action
component in the sitemap so far. Generally speaking I think a Sitemap
Action is an object that acts upon an application model based on data
supplied by the environments objectModel (ie Request). It's its
responsibility to make some data available to the Sitemap engine as
further selection/matching criteria (a List object) as well as in the
objectModel for other sitemap components

Suppose the Interface of an Actions is like this:

   public Interface Action {
       public List act (Map objectModel);
   }

and also suppose that the nested elements of the <map:act> elements are
skipped if the action returns a null value instead of a List.

 <match type="uri" pattern="myapp/**">
   <act type="myaction">
     <select type="action-selector">
       <when test="remove"/>
         <generate src="myapp/{1}/remove.xsp"/>
       </when>
       ...
     </select>
   </act>
 </match>

The List object supplied by the action is used by the sitemap engine to
replace occurrences like {1} from certain attributes like src= but this
is optional. So the Action is not really associated to a resource. It's
the selector which does this association.

Agreed.

> How granular can actions be ?

You should be able to be as granular as you want.

> Does session validation count as an action ?

Why not?

> How about authorisation and authentication ?

I still suppose to leave authentication to the container but I know
someone will do it with a sitemap component :/
Authorisation is more dependant on the application context and there are
the possibilities to use AuthorisationMatchers, AuthorisationSelectors,
AuthorisationActions or a authorisation logicsheet, what ever suit your
needs best.

> What about form validation ?

Even here, it depends. If you only want to validate form data a Selector
can be used to achieve that and in the <map:when> elements you
regenerate the resource if validation fails or choose an action to put
the form data into your application model and generate the next screen
or whatever.

> When I program actions I use a extremely granular approach.

No problem, you should be able to do things like that

 <match type="uri" pattern="myapp/**">
   <act type="session validation">
     <act type="form-validation">
       <select type="validation-check">
         <when test="ok">
           <act type="model-update"/>
           <generate src="next-page"/>
         </when>
         <otherwise>
           <generate src="this-page"/>
         </otherwise>
       </select>
     </act>
   </act>
   <generate src="login"/>
 </match>

Isn't this a matter how components play together?

Didn't get the last one? What is a FormDBEntryAction for? Probably an
XSP page?

Please answer these question yourself after you've read my explanations.

Implementing the framework to use actions like I've mentioned through
out this mail is a matter of an hour or two. But you're right
implementing general actions for general usage is another thing.
