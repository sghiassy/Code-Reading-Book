<H2>hsqldb v.1.61 Hello World</H2>
This short documentat will help you create, compile and run your own applications 
using the hsqldb v.1.61 database. There are a lot of different ways to do this, 
and this documentation demonstrates just one. There are a lot of different IDEs 
(integrated development environments) available, and it's not possible to explain 
it for all of them. In this documentation, just the JDK and command line tools 
are used. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Download and install the JDK from Sun (java.sun.com)
<P>
<LI>
Create your own directory and Java source code file. As an example, 
create the path 'C:\TestJava' and copy the file 'FileTest.java' from 
the 'src' directory there. 
<P>
<LI>
Compile your application. This can be done in the command line. 
Change to the directory C:\TestJava and type:
    <P> <CODE>javac org\hsqldb\util\FindFile.java</CODE> 
    <P>
  <LI> To successfully run the application, you will need additionally the hsqldb 
    v.1.61 package. Copy the file 'hsqldb.jar' from the ~\lib directory to the 
    directory C:\TestJava. 
    <P>
<LI>
Run the application. You will have to tell Java that is has
to look in the .jar file for classes, too. Otherwise you will 
get an error message that the driver was not found 
(java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.hsql.jdbcDriver).
In the directory C:\TestJava, type:
    <P> <CODE>java -classpath %CLASSPATH%;hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.FindFile</CODE> 
    <P>
or, if you are using JDK 1.2, you may type:
    <P> <CODE>java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.FindFile</CODE> 
    <P>
<LI>
If it was successfull, the program will print the usage info.
