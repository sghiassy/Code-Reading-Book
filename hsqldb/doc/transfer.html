<H2>hsqldb v.1.61 Transfer Tool</H2>
This tool is able to transfer data from one JDBC data source to another. The application 
is not limited to hsqldb, it can (theoretically) transfer from any database to 
another, as long as the appropriate JDBC drivers are available (this includes 
JDBC-ODBC, so Miccrosoft Access is included - for a list of available JDBC drivers, 
go to <a href="http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers/search-results/1,2722,,00.html">Sun's 
JDBC driver site</a>. 
<P>
<H3>Transfer</H3>
There is a batch file provided in the demo directory.
To startup the application on Windows type:
<P>
<CODE>run Transfer</CODE>
<P>
You will have to connect to the source database,
then to the target database. After you are connected,
all tables of the source database will be listed.
The transfer for each table can be enabled/disabled,
and modified. Then, the transfer can be started.
