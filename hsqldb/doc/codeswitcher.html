<H3>Code Switcher</H3>
CodeSwitcher is a tool to manage different version of Java source code. It helps 
to compile hsqldb v.1.61 for different JDKs, and to switch between debug and runtime 
version. It is something like a precompiler in C and C++, but it works directly 
on the source code and does not create intermediate output and does not create 
other files. 
<P>
It is possible to use the Code Switcher in batch operations where multiple 
versions of an application are built. CodeSwitcher is (of course) a Java application.
<P>
CodeSwitcher reads the source code of a file, remove comments where appropriate
and comment blocks that are not used for this version. This operation is
done for all files of a defined directory, and all subdirectories.
<P>
This is an example source code before CodeSwitcher is used:
<P>
<PRE><code>
      ...
//#ifdef JAVA2
      pProperties.store(out,"hsqldb database");
//#else
/*
      pProperties.save(out,"hsqldb database");
*/
//#endif
      ...
</code></PRE>
<P>
The next step is to run CodeSwitcher. This is done using a command line:
<P> <CODE>java org.hsqldb.util.CodeSwitcher . -JAVA2</CODE> 
<P>
The '.' means the program works on the current directory (all subdirectories
are processes recursivly). '-JAVA2' means the code labeled with JAVA2
must be switched off. And this is how the source code looks after 
CodeSwitcher has processed this file:
<P>
<PRE><code>
      ...
//#ifdef JAVA2
/*
      pProperties.store(out,"hsqldb database");
*/
//#else
      pProperties.save(out,"hsqldb database");
//#endif
      ...
</code></PRE>
<P> For detailed information on the command line options run 'java org.hsqldb.util.CodeSwitcher'.
