<H2>hsqldb v.1.61 In-Memory Applet: QueryTool</H2>

<P>
<H2>Description</H2>
In this demo, all data is kept in memory.<BR>
The data will be lost if the program is closed.<BR>
The QueryTool and the database are running<BR>
inside the internet browser.
<P>
<H2>If it does not work</H2>
On some browsers (Netscape 4.6?), the version compiled for
JDK 1.2 does not work. In the Java Console (Communicator
/ Extras / Java Console) you will get something like:
<P>
# Verifier error org/hsqldb/jdbcConnection.getTypeMap()Ljava/util/Map
<P> This means the class java.util.Map was not found. In JDK 1.1, this class does 
  not exist. When compiled for 1.2, there is a reference to this class required 
  to conform to the JDBC 2.0 interface. This class itself is never used, but the 
  reference is required anyway. It looks like most verifiers have no problems 
  with this, but some have. 
<P> The solution for this problem is to recompile (at least the client part) for 
  JDK 1.1. You will need to install JDK 1.1 before you can do this, then see:
