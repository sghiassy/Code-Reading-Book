HSQLDB v. 1.61

Changes 20 July 2001

The following enhancements and bug fixes have been introduced:
Patch or Bug tracking numbers are included where one exists.

Compatibility with version 1.43 databases.
Database files created with 1.43 can be opened with version 1.61. The
database is converted into the 1.6x format.

The LIMIT keyword for fetching only part of the result set.

SELECT LIMIT n m { selectExpression | table.* | * } [, ... ] .........

The LIMIT keyword can be used immediately after the SELECT keyword and has
two numbers as parameters. The query is executed as if LIMIT and its 
parameters were not present, then the rows after the offset position (n)
and specified by count (m) are returned. Offset n is counted from one.
"SELECT LIMIT 10 20 * FROM mytable" returns rows 11-30 only
Currently LIMIT cannot be used together with DISTINCT

Changes 06 July 2001


I have checked the bug reports and patches and indicated my opinion as to
which patches / bug fixes should be done for the 1.61 point release,
stating NO or OK. I have incorporated some of these and fixed one myself.
In addition, the patch for database migration from 1.43 to 1.6x that I 
submitted on 16 April should be incorporated into the point release.

There were 10 patches up to 16 April, which according to Mark, have been 
incorporated. Except:

OK-------416149 Swing interface for DatabaseManager - ok - but file is missing

Patches since 16 April:


OK-------418014 Trace specific exceptions - ok
INCORPORATED fredt

NO-------418017 Month format
		   fredt: - patch is ok - do we want this as it can break existing code

OK-------418019 Timestamp format - ok - won't break existing code
INCORPORATED fredt


OK-------418022 Char comparison
		   fredt: - patch is ok - do we want this as it can break existing code
         fredt: - now I think we should add it anyway. Side effects would be minimal.
INCORPORATED fredt


OK-------418023 SUBSTR - ok

Bugs


OK-------416138 Resolved: The user should use switchtojdk11 before the build

NO-------416139 Multiple result sets
         fredt: High Hopes?


  -------416140 PATCH for getMoreResults() - ok

ALREADY IN VERSION 1.60 fredt


OK-------416141 DatabaseMetaData.getExportedKeys() does not work :
		   fredt: I know this one from Hypersonic. May be able to fix it.

fredt: In DatabaseInformatio.java, getSystemTable(,,) creates a table on the
fly for metadata information and then fills it with information from tTable.
Code has been written to fill the SYSTEM_TABLES, SYSTEM_TYPES, etc.
but not FOREIGN_KEY etc. as these would be more complicated.
I hope to get a bit of extra time in the near future to implement
this and related calls, getExportedKeys(), getCrossReference(), etc.


  -------416142 SAME AS ABOVE


OK-------416143 PATCH LONGVARBINARY - ok

ALREADY IN VERSION 1.60

OK-------416144 PATCH for GROUP BY - has side effect
  -------416146 SAME AS ABOVE

INCORPORATED fredt: fixed with different code without side effect

OK-------416325 complaint by user -
		   fredt: If they submit their changes we will incorporate into the CVS.


OK-------416357 DB transition - documentation issue - If anyone has a
         half-finished doc we can put it up and ask users / developers to
         contibute and finish it. Mike seems to have done something about this.


OK-------423114 Timestamp - Mike and Mark were looking into this.
		   fredt: If no results I can have a go.

Changes to HSQLDB v. 1.60 directory structure and introduction of an
Ant build.xml


The original directory structure of HypersonicSQL had evolved around a set of
demos and the hsql.jar file was located in the /demo directory.

There was no /lib directory and the javax.servlet classes were in the same
folder as the source code. This arrangement was somewhat useful with jdk1.1.x
as it did not require a classpath argument for some of the compile and run tasks.
But it has no major advantage with jdk1.3.

In HSQLDB, all classes are in the org.hsqldb. tree, compared to HypersonicSQL's
org.hsql. This change already dictates that any existing .html, .bat, .sh and
other command files that are in use for running the database, or its utility
classes, have to be edited to reflect the new tree name.

HypersonicSQL only included .bat files for development and running tasks. The
development of Apache Ant has made it possible to perform compile and build tasks
in a platform-independent manner. So a build.xml script for Ant is highly
desireable.
 
These circumstances justify the introduction a new directory structure which
follows the standards used by Sun and others to distribute Java programs. 


Changes:

Summary of Changes:

/bin /lib and /classes directories have been added to the rool directory of the
installation. Some existing files have been moved to these directories. All
command files have been updated to work within the new structure.

Details of Changes:

/bin is almost empty now but will hold .bat and .sh files used for creating
databases and running different configuration of the server. Unlike the
versions in /demo, these will not create a test database and will expect the
user to specify a database. 
(.sh files will be addes after some work to make them independent of java
runtime location)

/lib contains the javax.servlet precompiled classes (moved from /src) and is
the location of the hsqldb.jar file when it is created.

/classes contains the org.hsqldb classes while the .jar is being built and
CodeSwitcher.java is used to convert source code. It is normally deleted after
the operation.

In /src there is an Ant build.xml that builds the hsqldb.jar. (Ant must be 
already installed). To use it, change to /src then type:

ant

This displays the command line options which include

ant jar              to make the hsqldb.jar
ant clean            to clean up the /classes directory that is created type:
ant cleanall         to remove the old jar as well
ant switchtojdk11    to process and change the code for jdk1.1.x
ant switchtojdk12    to process and change the code for jdk1.2.x and 1.3.x

In /demo all the html and bat files have been changed to reflect the
new relative location of the hsqldb.jar file. The .bat files all work.

In .html files, the codebase argument was added to the Applet tag. The
in-memory and client-server .html demos all work

/src/build.bat works with jdk1.1x and above. It puts the hsqldb.jar file in
/lib and takes account of the new location of javax classes.

All the other .bat files work, except:

switchtoprofile.bat
switchtoruntime.bat

There is a problem with the same .bat files in HypersonicSQL 1.43. The  new format 
of the 1.60 code and the addition of comments in 1.60 just result in extra
errors. 

THESE .bat FILES CORRUPT THE SOURCES, so that if they are performed one followed
by the other, the sources no longer compile correctly (tested with jdk1.3).

***I suggest not to include them in the distribution until there is a
resolution.

I think the new directory structure can be introduced as the remaining minor
problems are definitely not related to the change of dirctory structure.

Tests have been performed on Win NT 4 SP6A with jdk1.3.0_02 and jdk1.1.8. In
both test environments, a minimal classpath was used. Internet Explorer 5.5 was
used for testing .html Applets

Changes 16 April 2001



By Fred Toussi fredt@users.sourceforege.net


Database.java

Log.java



Enable opening database files created with older version of hsql but disable

opening databases created with later versions (1.60 and 1.61 are considered

the same version but 1.60 and 1.70 are different versions)

Has been tested and is unlikely to have any side effects







Parser.java

Select.java



Introduced the additions made by Hybris to 1.43 code, resulting in 1.50

These additions implement the LIMIT keyword e.g.

"select limit 10 20 * from mytable" returns rows 11-30 only



Additions made by Hybris for cosmetic or debugging purposes were ignored.

Has been checked and tested and is unlikely to have any side effects.

Changes in 1.60

Several minor fixes, code formatted to Sun standards, Javadoc comments started.

Issues Addressed:

Problem: LONGVARBINARY error using setObject.
    When using setObject to set the value of a binary column a class cast
    error occured. Added methods to resolve this, bug and fix submitted by ?.

Problem: BINARY data types were limited to 32K.
    Added support for larger objects. Bug and fix submitted by Jonathan Tappan.
    
Problem: Cached table corruption
    Modified Cache class to update free space list correctly. Bug and fix 
    submitted by Jonathan Tappan.
    
Problem: readonly property causes stack dump in Log class
    Bug and fix submitted by Donatella Mori and Richard Hoad.
    
Problem: getMoreResults fails to follow JDBC spec.
    Bug and fix submitted by Brent Boyer.
    
Problem: Subselect bugs
    Bug and fix submitted by Mark Muday.
    
Problem: hsql connection type converted to http by jdbcConnection class.
    Bug and fix submitted by Elize Jensen.
    
Problem: INTERNAL connection type being closed incorrectly, causing, among other 
    things, CALL IDENTITY() to fail.  Bug and fix provided by Mauro Canal.

New Features:    
    
Extended SQL syntax for DROP TABLE to allow 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <table>'. 

Logicscope Realisations Ltd. graciously sponsored Peter Hudson who developed
the trigger implementation for HSQLdb.

Postponed Features:

Reworked transactions mechanism.  The problem with the old mechanism 
(as I understand it) was that during a transaction, the uncommited records were 
available to other channels, i.e. they can read uncommitted changes that may be
rolled back in the case of an aborted transaction.  The modification 
allows 2 phase transactions, where the updates are not visible outside of the 
Channel until the transaction is committed. Patch submitted by Valerio Aimale.  
The concept is sound, but the changes caused problems, perhaps due to other changes 
in this release.
