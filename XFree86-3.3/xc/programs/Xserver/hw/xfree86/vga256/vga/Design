This new frame buffer code is designed to rely on the cfb code more than
the previous cfb.banked code. This frame buffer eliminates the need to
compile cfb in two places. This design is more similar to what is being
done by the accelerated servers.

Some of the function in this new frame buffer code have been updated
to reflect some cfb changes that were implemented after cfb.banked
diverged in the pre-R5 days. This should result in improved accuracy
when running the X Test Suite.

The cfb frame buffer code can be roughly broken into two parts. The first
part is the "upper half" which implementes a packed pixel framebuffer. The
second part is the "lower half" which actually performs the rendering in
the frame buffer.

The vga frame buffer simply replaces the lower half of the cfb code with a
version of the functions that perform bank switching as needed. These function
are replaced by overridding the entries in the Screen structure, and also
by specifying the vga function in the GC structures.

Some of the function fromthe upper half are also duplicated here because
they call some of the lower functions directly, thus the cfb version of the
function would not work (sigh 8-().

This frame buffer code pulls in the routines from the "enhanced" directory
and renames some of them for consistancy.

Some of functions that are "bank aware" have added a check at the begining
that checks to see if the Drawable is not a window. If not, then the regular
cfb version of the function is called instead. The cfb routines should be
slightly fast for pixmaps since they don;t have the banking overhead.

Hopefully, this code can be examined further, adn some of the banking macros
can  be eliminated completely. If a function will only be called (of will have
the pixmap case handled by cfb), then it might be possible to eliminte the 
use of the vgaRead/Writeflag, and the addition test that is made each time the
pixel is incremented.

Some of the enhanced function work by performing unbanked operations inside
bank sized regions, and changint he banks only in the outmost loop. This is
similar to the high-level banking design used by the Xsvga X Server. There
may be more opportunities to do this kind optimization on some of the other
routines.

Many of the updates applied to this code involved replacing code with newer
macros that have the same affect, but make the code easier to read. Also,
in many areas (like the GC code), code was replaced with calls to the mi
equivilent which is also used by the current cfb code. Overall, the total
amount of code in this frame buffer code has been reduced from the cfb.banked
code.
