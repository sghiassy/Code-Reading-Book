<title>ATI adapters README
<author>Marc Aurele La France
<date>23 March 1996
<abstract>
This is the README for the XFree86 ATI VGA driver used in the XF86_Mono,
XF86_VGA16 and XF86_SVGA servers.
Users of ATI adapters based on the Mach8, Mach32 or Mach64 (including 3D Rage
and 3D Rage II) accelerators should
be using the accelerated servers (XF86_Mach8, XF86_Mach32 or XF86_Mach64).
The unaccelerated servers (XF86_Mono, XF86_VGA16 and XF86_SVGA) should still
work, but are a waste of capabilities.

<sect> What is the ATI VGA driver?<p>
The ATI VGA driver is a 256-colour, 16-colour and monochrome driver for
XFree86.
The driver is intended for all ATI video adapters except those that do not
provide SuperVGA functionality (such as some early Mach8 and Mach32 adapters).
The following approximate maximum resolutions (based on the Golden Ratio of x/y
= (1 + sqrt(5))/2) are possible depending on the video memory available on the
adapter (and the capabilities of your monitor):
<verb>
    256k    640x409x256    896x585x16
    512k    896x585x256   1280x819x16
    1M     1280x819x256  1824x1149x16</verb>
Maximum monochrome resolutions are the same as those for 16-colour mode,
because the monochrome server uses a maximum of one fourth of the available
video memory.<p>
<sect> What is the ATI VGA driver *not*?<p>
This driver does not yet support more than 8 bits of pixel depth.
Even if your manual says that your graphics adapter supports modes using more
than 256 colours, the ATI VGA driver will not use these modes.<p>
The ATI VGA driver is not an accelerated driver.
If your adapter is based on the Mach8, Mach32 or Mach64 video controllers, this
driver will not use the accelerated functions of the hardware.
It will only use the VGA hardware (which, for Mach32's and Mach64's, is
integrated into the accelerator).
This can make opaque moves, for example, quite jerky.<p>
<sect> What video adapters will the driver work with?<p>
Most adapters harbouring the following ATI video controller chips will work
with this driver:
<verb>
VGA Wonder series:  18800, 18800-1, 28800-2, 28800-4, 28800-5, 28800-6
    Mach32 series:  68800-3, 68800-6, 68800AX, 68800LX
    Mach64 series:  88800GX-C, 88800GX-D, 88800GX-E, 88800GX-F, 88800CX,
                    264CT, 264ET, 264VT, 264VT2, 264GT</verb>
The 264xT series are integrated controllers, meaning that they include an
internal RAMDAC and clock generator.
Some early Mach32 adapters will not work with this driver because they do not
provide VGA functionality.
Also, early Mach8 adapters will not work for the same reason, unless the
adapter also has a video controller from the VGA Wonder series (or is connected
to one through the VGA passthrough connector).<p>
These adapters are available with a variety of clock generators and RAMDACs.
See the XF86Config section below for details.
These adapters are available with or without a mouse.<p>
VGA Wonder V3 adapters use a 18800 video controller and generate dot clocks
with crystals.
VGA Wonder V4 adapters have a 18800-1 and also use crystals.
VGA Wonder V5 adapters also use a 18800-1, but have a 18810 clock generator.
VGA Wonder+ adapters use a 28800-2 and a 18810.
Other than these, ATI's adapter naming convention (if it can be said that one
exists) starts to fall apart.<p>
The VGA Wonder series was also available through ATI's OEM channel under the
name VGA1024.
Thus, the ATI VGA driver also supports VGA1024, VGA1024D, VGA1024XL,
VGA1024DXL and VGA1024VLB adapters, among others.<p>
<sect>What should I put in my XF86Config file?<p>
The chipset will be automatically detected.
The chipset name for this driver is "ati".
The driver also recognizes "vgawonder", "mach8", "mach32" and "mach64" as
chipset names.
In this version of the driver, all names are equivalent.
In some future version each name will have a different meaning to be
documented at that time.<p>
The clocks line to be specified in your XF86Config depends on what the adapter
uses to generate dot clocks.<p>
For all adapters, one of the following clocks specifications (or an initial
subset thereof) can be used depending on what the adapter uses to generate dot
clocks:

Mach32 and Mach64 owners should only specify up to the first 32 frequencies.<p>
The oldest Mach64 adapters use one of the clock generators described above.
The possibilities for Mach64 adapters also include programmable clock
generators.
At bootup, video BIOS initialization programmes an initial set of frequencies.
Two of these are reserved to allow the setting of modes that do not use a
frequency from this initial set.
One of these reserved slots is used by the BIOS mode set routine, the other by
the particular driver used (MS-Windows, AutoCAD, X, etc.).
The clock numbers reserved in this way are dependent on the particular clock
generator used on the adapter.<p>
If the driver does not support the adapter's clock generator, it will try to
match the clocks to one of the following specifications.  This matching will
occur whether or not the user specifies the clocks in XF86Config.
<verb>
BIOS setting 1:

  Clocks   0.000 110.000 126.000 135.000  50.350  56.640  63.000  72.000
           0.000  80.000  75.000  65.000  40.000  44.900  49.500  50.000
           0.000  55.000  63.000  67.500  25.180  28.320  31.500  36.000
           0.000  40.000  37.500  32.500  20.000  22.450  24.750  25.000</verb>
<verb>
BIOS setting 2:

  Clocks   0.000 110.000 126.000 135.000  25.180  28.320  31.500  36.000
           0.000  80.000  75.000  65.000  40.000  44.900  49.500  50.000

           0.000  40.000  37.500  32.500  20.000  22.450  24.750  25.000</verb>
<verb>
BIOS setting 3:

  Clocks   0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000  25.180  28.320   0.000   0.000

           0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000   0.000</verb>
If the driver matches the clocks to the third setting above, functionality will
be *extremely* limited (assuming the driver works at all).<p>
Other clock generators that have been used on ATI adapters (which can all be
said to be clones of one of the above) might generate non-zero frequencies for
those that are zero above, or vice-versa.<p>
The order of the clocks *is* very important, although the driver will reorder
the clocks if it deems it appropriate to do so.
Mach32 and Mach64 owners should note that this order is different than what
they would use for the accelerated servers.<p>
If the driver detects a supported programmable clock generator, it will ignore
any XF86Config clock specification and programme the generator as needed by the
modes to be used during the X session.<p>
A clock probe, done with the command "X -probeonly", will help you decide which
of the above to use for your particular adapter.
If the server consistently reports that it has detected an unknown clock
generator, please e-mail me the stderr output.<p>
Modes can be derived from the information in XFree86's doc directory.
If you do not specify a "modes" line in the display subsection of the
appropriate screen section of your XF86Config, the driver will generate a
default mode and attempt to use it.
The timings for the default mode are derived from the timings of the mode
(usually a text mode) in effect when the server is started.<p>
<sect> What is the history of the driver?<p>
The complete history of the driver is rather cloudy.
The following is probably incomplete and inaccurate.<p>
Apparently, <bf>Per Lindqvist</bf> (<it>pgd@compuram.bbt.se</it>) first got an
ATI driver working with an early ATI card under X386 1.1a.
This original driver may have actually been based on an non-functional ATI
driver written by <bf>Roell</bf>.
Then <bf>Doug Evans</bf> (<it>dje@cygnus.com</it>) ported the driver to the ATI
VGA Wonder XL, trying in the process to make the driver work with all other ATI
cards.<p>
<bf>Rik Faith</bf> (<it>faith@cs.unc.edu</it>) obtained the X11R4 driver from
Doug Evans in the summer of 1992, and ported the code to the X386 part of
X11R5.
This subsequently became part of XFree86.<p>
I (<bf>Marc Aurele La France</bf>) took the driver over in the fall of 1993
after Rik got rid of his VGA Wonder card.<p>
<sect> Miscellaneous notes<p>
In all cases, virtual resolutions must be less than 4096 pixels wide.
For VGAWonder V3 adapters with 256kB of video memory, and for all 264xT
adapters, the 256-colour server will further limit virtual resolutions to less
than 2048 pixels wide.
These are hardware limits that cannot be circumvented.<p>
Dot clocks greater than 80MHz cannot be used on most adapters as a way still
needs to be discovered to make the VGA Wonder controller do pixel
multiplexing.<p>
Support for more than 8bpp colour depth is pending proper RAMDAC handling and
banked framebuffer code for >8bpp.<p>
Video memory corruption can still occur during mode switches on V3, V4 and V5
adapters.
Symptoms of this problem include garbled fonts on return to text mode, and
various effects (snow, dashed lines, etc) on initial entry into a graphics
mode.
In the first case, the workaround is to use some other means of restoring the
text font.
On Linux, this can be done with the kbd or svgalib packages.
In the second case, xrefresh will usually cleanup the image.<p>
Video memory banking does not work in the 16-colour and monochrome servers on
V3, V4 and V5 adapters (with 512kB of video memory).
This appears to be a hardware limitation.
The driver's default behaviour has been changed to take this into consideration
by limiting video memory to 256kB.<p>
Interlaced modes do not work in the monochrome server on 28800-x adapters when
using a virtual resolution that is 2048 pixels or wider.
This appears to be a hardware limitation.
The driver has been changed to prune modes accordingly.<p>
Support for virtual resolutions using more than 1MB of video memory is still
incomplete.
Specifically, such support works on Mach32 adapters, and on 264xT adapters,
but not on any other Mach64 adapters.
On 88800GX and 88800CX adapters, this appears to be a hardware limitation.
Consequently, the driver's default behaviour is to limit video memory to
1MB.<p>
There is some controversy over whether or not clocks higher than 135MHz should
be allowed on 264xT adapters.
For now, clocks will be limited to 135MHz by default.  
This limit can only be increased (up to a driver-calculated absolute maximum)
through the DACSpeed option in XF86Config.
Be aware however that doing this is untested and might damage the adapter.<p>
The default mode does not work on the more recent Mach64 adapters.
This will be fixed in a future release by reading the programmable clock
generator's registers.<p>
Future development plans include addressing the above problems and using
accelerated functionality.<p>
