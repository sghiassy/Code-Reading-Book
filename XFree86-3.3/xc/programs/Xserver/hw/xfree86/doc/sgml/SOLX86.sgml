<sect>What is XFree86 3.3<p>

	XFree86 3.3 is a port of X11R6.3 that supports several versions of 
	Intel-based Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2 which was the X server 
	distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many new features 
	and 
	performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The release is 
	available as source patches against the X Consortium code, as well as 
	binary distributions for many architectures.
<p>
The sources for XFree86 are available by anonymous ftp from:

<sect> Solaris for x86, versions on which XFree86 3.3 has been tested<p>

XFree86 3.3 has been actively tested on:
<itemize>
<!--
<item>Solaris 2.1 for x86
<item>Solaris 2.4 EA1 for x86
-->
<item>Solaris 2.4 for x86 FCS
<item>Solaris 2.5.1 for x86
</itemize>
And is expected to run under:
<itemize>
<item>Solaris 2.4 EA2 for x86
<item>Solaris 2.5 for x86
</itemize>

<sect>The VT-switching sub-system in Solaris x86<p>

	The virtual terminal sub-system is a undocumented, and unsupported 
	feature of Solaris x86. Therefore if you use Virtual Terminals, you 
	do so at <bf>YOUR OWN RISK</bf>.<p>

	The virtual terminals of Solaris work basically the same way as 
	most other Intel based SVR4 VT sub-systems.  However, there are a 
	number of limitations documented below.<p>

	First, if you are running a Solaris 2.4 x86 system, and you want VT's, 
	you will have to create the necessary devices first, so become root.<p>

	First verify the chanmux device driver's major number is 100:<p>
<tscreen><verb>
	# grep -i chanmux /etc/name_to_major
	chanmux 100
	#
</verb></tscreen>
	If the number after 'chanmux' is anything but 100, I would suggest 
	you immediately abort your attempt to create virtual terminals, and 
	learn to live without them.<p> 

	However, if it is 100, then as root type the following commands to 
	create the maximum allowable number of virtual terminals.<p>
<tscreen><verb>
	# cd /dev
	# mknod vt01 c 100 1
	# mknod vt02 c 100 2 
	# mknod vt03 c 100 3
	# mknod vt04 c 100 4
	# mknod vt05 c 100 5
	# mknod vt06 c 100 6
	# mknod vt07 c 100 7
</verb></tscreen>
	There is no need for a reconfiguration boot.<p>

	Secondly, for both 2.1, and 2.4 x86 systems, add a few lines to the 
	<tt/inittab/ to enable logins on them.<p>

(<bf>Note</bf>, do <bf>NOT</bf> make a mistake here, you could 
lock yourself out of the system)<p>
<verb>
--------------------->Snip Snip<-----------------------------------------------
v1:234:respawn:/usr/lib/saf/ttymon -g -h -p "`uname -n` VT01 login: " -T AT386 -d /dev/vt01 -l console
v2:234:respawn:/usr/lib/saf/ttymon -g -h -p "`uname -n` VT02 login: " -T AT386 -d /dev/vt02 -l console
v3:234:respawn:/usr/lib/saf/ttymon -g -h -p "`uname -n` VT03 login: " -T AT386 -d /dev/vt03 -l console

---------------------->End Here<----------------------------------------------- 
</verb>
	These four lines enable four VT's on Alt-SysReq-F1 through 
	Alt-SysReq-F4.<p>

	Then execute the command '<tt>init q</tt>' to immediately 
	enable the virtual 
	terminals.<p>

The keys used for VT switching are as follows:<p>

<quote>
	<tt>Alt-SysReq-F1</tt> through <tt>Alt-SysReq-F7</tt> 
	enable VT screens 1-7 respectively 
	(if the VT is active).<p>
	<tt>Alt-SysReq-n</tt> enables the next active VT screen.<p>
	<tt>Alt-SysReq-p</tt> enables the previous active VT screen.<p>
	<tt>Alt-SysReq-h</tt> returns to the console.<p>
</quote>
	If you are using virtual terminals, you must leave at least one free 
	for use by the Xserver.<p>


Limitations of the virtual terminal sub-system under Solaris x86:<p>

	There are only a total of 8 available VT's (7 normal VT's + 1 console) 
	not the usual 15. If you have all 8 allocated, and you attempt to 
	allocate a additional VT you will panic the system. (This bug is 
	worked around in the Solaris XFree86 Xserver.)<p>

	From a programming stand point, they work pretty much as documented in 
	the AT&amp;T Unix System V/386 Release 4 Integrated Software 
	Development 
	Guide, however a number of <tt>ioctl()</tt> calls are broken.<p>


<sect>Notes for building XFree86 on Solaris x86<p>

<enum>
<item>The majority of all modifications you will need to make are now in 
	<tt>~xc/config/cf/xf86site.def</tt>.

<!--
	except one. You will need to set OSName, 
	and OSMinorVersion correctly in <tt>~xc/config/cf/sun.cf</tt>.

Under Solaris 2.1 for x86, <tt>sun.cf</tt> needs to read 
(near the top of the file)

<verb>	#ifdef SVR4Architecture
	#ifdef i386Architecture
	#define OSName			SunOS 5.1 x86
	XCOMM operating system:  OSName
	#define OSMajorVersion		5
	#define OSMinorVersion		1
</verb>

Under Solaris 2.4 for x86, <tt>sun.cf</tt> needs to read 
(near the top of the file)

<verb>	#ifdef SVR4Architecture
	#ifdef i386Architecture
	#define OSName			SunOS 5.4 x86
	XCOMM operating system:  OSName
	#define OSMajorVersion		5
	#define OSMinorVersion		4
</verb>
-->

<item>Both Gcc, and ProWorks are supported by XFree86. Gcc-2.5.8 or
        gcc-2.7.2  are 
	suggested, Gcc-2.6.0 is known not to work.  You also need to set 
	HasGcc2 correctly in <tt>~xc/config/cf/xf86site.def</tt>.

	You should also make certain your version of GCC predefines `sun'.
	2.4.5 is known NOT to by default.  If needed edit
	<tt>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/*/*/specs</tt>, and modify the
	<tt>*predefines:</tt> line.<p>

	Note: A Threaded Xlib compiled with GCC has subtle problems.
	It'll work 98&percnt; of the time, however clients will occasionally
	exhibit strange hangs. Most notably image viewers such as
	xv-3.10 exhibit this problem.<p>

	It is recommended that you set ThreadedX in
	<tt>~xc/config/cf/sun.cf</tt> to NO, if you are using GCC.
	ProWorks does not have this problem.

<item> To build XFree86 with gcc you need gcc and (optionally)
       c++filt from  GNU binutils. Don't install gas or ld from GNU
       binutils, use the one provided by Sun. 
       <p>
       With XFree86 3.3, you will need to setup a /opt/SUNWspro/bin
       directory containing symbolic links named <tt/cc/, <tt/CC/, and
       <tt/c++filt/ pointing respectively to the actual <tt/gcc/,
       <tt/g++/ and <tt/c++filt/ commands.

<item>If you don't have c++filt or if you have troubles in making
	World with c++filt, you need to set UseExportLists to NO in
	<tt>~xc/config/cf/host.def</tt>.<p>

<!--
	If you use c++filt, you need to check the definition of PATH in
	<tt>~xc/config/util/elistgen.sun</tt>.<p>
-->        

<item>If you are using ProWorks to compile the XFree86 distribution, you 
	need to modify your PATH appropriately so the ProWorks tools are 
	available. Normally, they should be in <tt>/opt/SUNWspro/bin</tt><p>


<item>You <bf>MUST</bf> put <tt>/usr/ccs/bin</tt>
 	at the front of your PATH. There are known 
	problems with some GNU replacements for the utilities found there. So 
	the <tt>/usr/ccs/bin</tt> versions of these programs 
must be found before any 
	other possible GNU versions. (Most notably GNU '<tt/ar/' does not work 
	during the build).<p>

<item>If you wish to use the "memory aperture" feature of the S3, and Mach32 
	servers, you need to compile, and install the Solaris x86 aperture 
	driver for memory mapped I/O support.  This driver is <bf>REQUIRED</bf>
	for the I128, P9000 and Mach 64 servers.<p>

	You  need to set HasSolx86apertureDrv to YES in 
	<tt>~xc/config/cf/xf86site.def</tt>.<p> to enable the aperture
	driver. 

        Under Solaris 2.5 and 2.5.1, there's a system driver
        (<tt>/dev/xsvc</tt> that provides this functionality. It will
        be detected automatically by the server, so you don't need to
        install the driver.

	For Solaris 2.1 and 2.4, the source for this driver is included in 
	<tt>~xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/etc/apSolx86.shar</tt>.  
	Building, and 
	installing the driver is relatively straight forward. Please read 
	its accompanying README file.<p>

<sect> Notes for running XFree86 on Solaris x86<p>

<enum>
<item>If you have not made the Virtual Terminal devices, you will need to 
	specify the terminal device to run the Xserver on.  The correct 
	device is vt00 so your <tt>xinit</tt> command would look like so:<p>
<tscreen><verb>
		xinit -- vt00
</verb></tscreen>
	If you have made the virtual terminal devices you do not need to 
	specify the VT to run the Xserver on.<p>

	To be able to run XF86Setup, you must at least create
	/dev/vt01. Otherwise XF86Setup won't start.

<item>For Solaris you will probably want to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to 
	<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/dt/lib</tt>.  
	Including <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib</tt> in your 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH is probably not necessary, however it doesn't hurt. :)
<p>
	Including <tt>/usr/openwin/lib</tt> in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is 
	recommended 
	because some Sun supplied binaries were not compiled with LD_RUN_PATH 
	set properly at compile time.<p>
<p>
        Motif and CDE applications may require <tt>/usr/dt/lib</tt> in your
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH too.

<item>Xqueue is <bf>NOT</bf> supported under Solaris. 
	The includes necessary for 
	Xqueue are available, however the driver does not seem to be in the 
	kernel. (Go figure)<p>


<item>If you want to use xdm with Solaris, extract the files from the shar 
	file in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/XdmConf.svr4</tt> into a temporary 
	directory. The <tt>README</tt> file tells where 
	the individual files need to 
	be installed.  Be sure to read through each file and make any 
	site-specific changes that you need.<p>

</enum>

<sect> Known bugs, and work arounds with Solaris x86<p>

<enum>

<item>The Solaris 2.1 for x86 OpenWindows filemgr does not work against a 
	X11R5 Xserver, it probably will also not work against a X11R6 
Xserver.  
	Attempting to 'Drag and Drop' a file causes the filemgr to abort 
	with a 'X error'<p>

	Solaris 2.4 does not have this problem.<p>

	There is no known work around.<p>

<!--
<item>It has been reported that the aperture driver doesn't work
        under Solaris 2.5.1. It probably doesn't work either under
	2.5. 
-->

</enum>
<sect> Bug Notification<p>

	Bug reports need to be sent to <bf/XFree86@XFree86.org/, or posted to 
	the comp.windows.x.i386unix newsgroup.  Questions or comments about 
	the Solaris support, or the Solaris distribution need to be made to 
	<it/davidh@use.com/, or <it/danson@lgc.com./<p>
